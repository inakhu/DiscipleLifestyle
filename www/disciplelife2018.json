Biblical\r\ntestimonies about God are quite revealing. The eternal true God\r\nreveals Himself to us as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes but without division of nature, essence, or being. The Bible portrays in abundance countless number of God's natural and moral qualities which describe who God is and how He has worked through history. Our focus in this lesson is on four of such qualities of God which represent part of our beliefs about God as the people called \"Baptists\". An exposure into this will increase our knowledge of God and give us a better understanding of ourselves in line with His purpose for us to become like Him.  <\/p>\r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> God as the Creator <\/h5>\r\n        <p>In accordance with the Scriptures, Baptists believe that there is one and only one living and true God who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth while man is His creation. God is the Maker, Preserver and Ruler of all things (Genesis 1:1__2:15; Psalm 102:25). We believe the eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. <\/p>\r\n      \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        If you truly see yourself as a child of God who remains the ultimate Creator, what responsibility does this privilege place on you? \r\n        <\/p>\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  God as Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient <\/h5> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\r\n        <p>Baptists strongly believe that God is omnipotent (all powerful); omnipresent (God is present everywhere at the same time); and omniscient (God knows everything). These attributes of God underscore the reality of His care, concern and security for us. We equally believe that God knows everything about us. His eyes cover everywhere and we are safe in His powerful hands (Psalm 139:1-8). Throughout the Scripture, we see the evidence of God's presence, power, and knowledge manifesting in His dealings with mankind. <\/p> <!--  CONTENT HERE -->\r\n      \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        <!--  SHARING TIME CONTENT HERE -->\r\n        How does God's omniscient nature affect our lives in relation to personal holiness and righteousness? \r\n        <\/p>\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>God Is Love  <\/h5> <!--  EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD TITLE -->\r\n        <p>Divine love is God's benevolent care and concern for His creatures. Baptists hold that God's love is an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3, John 13:1). His love is unchanging, unfailing and steadfast (Deuteronomy 7:12; Lamentations 3:22). God's love is selfless, sacrificial, self-giving, self denying love (John 10:17-18). God's  \t\r\n\r\nsacrificial love is fully, maximally and uniquely demonstrated in the incarnation of His Son, Jesus Christ. So, God continues to demonstrate this love to us unconditionally; everyone who has truly experienced this love holds it a duty to demonstrate same to fellow human beings through caring, giving and mutual forgiveness. Throughout the Bible, we see the evidence of unconditional love which was ultimately fulfilled in the giving of His Son, Jesus to pay the penalty of our sins. <\/p> <!--  CONTENT HERE -->\r\n      \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        <!--  SHARING TIME CONTENT HERE -->\r\n        Someone confesses \"I find it difficult to forgive when people offend me.\" How will you describe the spiritual condition of this person? \r\n        <\/p>\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  God Is Holy <\/h5>\r\n        <p> Baptists believe that God is infinitely holy. Holiness depicts the being and the doing of God as sound, whole, complete and perfect (Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 3:7, 4:8). The holy nature of God demands that whoever will worship Him acceptably should take after Him in holiness and righteousness. This word \"holy\" speaks of His transcendence, or the fact that He is infinitely exalted above all of creation. Hence, His command to us to be perfect (Matthew 5:48; 1 Peter 1:15-16). The demand to be perfect is a definite command to desire to live a holy life of excellence as we face temptations on daily basis. <\/p>  \r\n      \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n          How can you satisfy the demand of the Scripture to be holy with the realities of life? \r\n        <\/p>\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        The God of the Bible is one God who manifests Himself as God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. Although God manifests Himself in three persons, He is still one. Man by instinct believes in the existence of God for he is born with a universal belief in a Supreme Being who created and sustains all things in love, holiness, presence, power and knowledge. It is only a fool that will deny the existence of\r\n         God (Psalm 53:1). That is why the Bible nowhere attempts to prove the existence of God but rather points to His unquestionable Being. Right from the first verse of the Bible (Genesis 1:1) to the end; throughout the whole Bible, God is seen to BE not dependent on anyone or anything to exist. \r\n        <\/p>\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> List five values and virtues in our society you are to live out.  <\/li>\r\n        <li> Discuss how biblically correct these assertions are (a) \"God is love\" (b) \"Love is not God\".  <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":2,"title":"baptist belief about the scripture ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> JANUARY: WEEK 2 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> BAPTIST BELIEF ABOUT THE SCRIPTURE  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 179<\/b>  Holy Bible, Book Divine   <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>  2 Timothy 3:16-17   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Explain some bases for accepting the Scripture as the inspired Word of God.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> List some characteristics of inerrancy regarding the Scriptures.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <li> Mention the books that make up the canonised Bible.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Discussion\r\n        <\/p> <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            The Baptists down the centuries have always been referred to as `the People of the Book'. This is as a result of the Church's strong and ardent belief in the Bible. For the Baptists, the Holy Bible is regarded as the basis for all acts and lifestyles. All practices and polities are determined by the Bible. In view of the current wave of worldliness and secularity threatening the devotional life of many Christians, will you as a disciple still consider the contemporary Baptist men and women as `the People of the Book? \r\n         <\/p> <!-- MESSAGE  1 -->\r\n                    \r\n        <h4>Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks<\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        Baptists believe that the Holy Bible, otherwise known as \"the Holy\r\nBook\" or \"the Holy Writ\" is the final authority in matters of faith.\r\nThis is as a result of the contents of the Book which copiously reveal the principles by which God relates, interacts with, and judges man. Our focus at this juncture is to shed light on few of our beliefs about the Scripture specifically in areas of its inspiration, inerrancy, authority and canonicity. A reminder of this nature will definitely enrich \r\nour spiritual growth, enlighten our mind to the importance of the Bible and eventually enhance the edification of the body of Christ. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> The Scriptures as Inerrant <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe word \"inerrant\" implies the absence of error. Baptists believe that all Scriptures are void of errors and mistakes simply because of the fact that they are the products of divine inspiration (Psalm 18:30; Proverbs 30:5). Since God who Himself remains the centre of truth supervised the writing including the words and phrases used, the Baptists confidently hold the Bible free of any error. However, we must note that the degree of inerrancy in relation to the Bible is highly achieved and greatly appreciated when interpreted within the peculiar context of the passage and the intention of the writer (Psalm 119:138). \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What would you do if doing what God says in the Bible will cost you a valued relationship, a valued position, a valued possession, or even if it costs your life?\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>The Scriptures as Inspired Word of God <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nIt is the belief of Baptists that the Old and New Testaments were written by the inspiration of God. A reference to the Bible as \"inspired\" means that the infinite God chose human channels, human intellect and experience, through which to pour out His truth to all men. It further indicates that it is \"God breathed\". The belief of Baptists is that all Scriptures is breathed out by God into the hearts of the chosen men and women who wrote the different books of the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21). In other words, the Word of God is not of human origin but originates from God Himself. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Ponder on this: <em>\"There are elements of mystery in the way the Bible was brought to us.\"<\/em> Should this assertion lead us to reject its claim or rejoice at its truth? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> The Scriptures as the Sole and Final Authority <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nBaptists hold that the Holy Bible is the `sole and final authority' in matters of faith, polity, policies and all realms of Christian life. This belief emanated from our convictions about the inerrancy and the inspirational nature of the Bible. In view of this, Baptists, therefore accept the Holy Bible as the yardstick for determining the rightness and the wrongness of deeds, doctrines and practices. One mark of the authority of the Bible is its sufficiency; indicating that the sixty-six books of the Bible contains enough truth for handling all our religious and secular needs. Another mark of authority of the Bible is to be seen in its certainty. Every issue raised in the Word of God is characterised with the highest degree of certainty. In this vein, Baptists consider the Holy Bible as the sole and final authority for all saving knowledge, faith and obedience (Psalm 119:89). \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Understanding something of the nature, what witnesses do we have for the authenticity of Scripture? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  The Canonicity of the Scriptures<\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe word \"Canonicity\" means a rule or standard of measurement (Galatians 6:16). Its application to the Scriptures refers to the Bible's literary limits; that is, the authoritative body of writings with precise literary limits. The canonicity of the Scriptures answers the questions \"which types of books of the Bible were considered inspired, and for what reasons were they included in the Holy Bible?\" For Baptists, we believe that the canonical books (authoritative inspired books of the Bible) are sixty-six (39 books of the OT and 27 books of the NT). The grounds and the criteria for acceptance of the books are the veracity of the historical facts, Jesus' acknowledgement of the facts in the writings and the authenticity of the apostolic authorship of the books (Matthew 4:7; 5:17; Luke 4:16-21; 11:51; Colossians 4:16; Revelations 22:18). Other writings which lack these qualifications such as Apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, which are \r\naccepted by a few other branches of the Church are regarded by Baptists as uninspired and, therefore, should not form part of the canonical books.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Apart from the sixty-six canonised books of the Bible which we believe to be authoritative, mention two non-canonised books which other denominations use today. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        The Scriptures which were originally written to convey the mind of God undoubtedly remain the very Word of God. The divine inspiration that birthed these books makes them inerrant. As for Baptists, the entire Scripture is believed to be a perfect treasure of divine instruction which has God as its Author and salvation as its end. No wonder we consider it to be totally true and trustworthy. As Baptists, the Bible should remain the supreme standard by which all our conducts, creeds, and religious opinions are tried. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are the practical ways to resolve the contradictions on the issues of faith and works as discussed in both Romans 3:24; 4:1-3 and James 2:14-18, 24, 26?\r\n\t <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li>  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":3,"title":"baptist belief about god's purpose of grace","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> JANUARY: WEEK 3 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> BAPTIST BELIEF ABOUT GOD'S PURPOSE OF GRACE  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 200 <\/b> Grace Greater than Our Sins  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>  2 Samuel 9:1-13   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Define the concept of `Grace'.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Use different synonyms for the same word and  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <li> Explain two main purposes of God's grace in the lives of the disciples.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Case Study\r\n        <\/p> <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            A young Christian lady was led by the Holy Spirit to witness to a group of people in Masifa town in Osun State.

These words are popularly called the `Grace-Words' though they do not contain the word `Grace\" (Moffatt). As for the New Testament, the subject of grace involves forgiveness, salvation, repentance, regeneration and the love of God. Aptly put, GRACE means `God's Riches At Christ's Expense' (from the acronym: G-R-A-C-E). Every disciple must be\r\ngrateful to God for being a beneficiary of His grace even as we remind ourselves today of this unique privilege. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> By His Grace We Are Given What We Don't Deserve <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n        God's grace is commonly referred to as unmerited favour. Baptist Churches all over the world believe that all benefits and blessings, both natural and spiritual, are the products of God's grace. We believe that all our righteous acts and deeds are like filthy rags and that the best of us are children of disobedience by nature, birth and practice. No human being, however good or great, deserves God's blessing (Ephesians 2:1-3). However, as God's choice through His grace, we who have responded to the call into grace have become partakers of His many blessings of salvation, love, forgiveness, favour, kindness, justification, glorification, etc. It is through God's grace that we have access to this undeserved and unmerited favour. It is similar to the experience of Mephibosheth as reflected in our text for this lesson. David's question in 2 Samuel 9:1-3 whether there was anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom he could show kindness for Jonathan's sake reflects God's gracious desire for us. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        List five blessings you do not deserve but God graciously gives to you. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  By His Grace We Are Not Given What We Deserve <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n        Biblically, grace is something that is unmerited and undeserved.  It is not something a person can lay claim to as his right. Baptists believe we receive from God what we do not deserve or should earn in any way.  Paul says that our salvation is a gift of God and something that we could never achieve on our own merit. We deserve nothing from God neither does He owe us anything. The good that we experience is a result of the grace of God (Ephesians 2:5). God favours, or gives us good things that we do not deserve and can never earn. \r\n       Two kinds of grace can be seen in the way God relates with humans. Common grace refers to the sovereign grace which God bestows on all mankind regardless of their spiritual standing before Him, while saving grace is that special dispensation of grace whereby God sovereignly bestows unmerited divine assistance upon His elect for their regeneration and sanctification.\r\n         <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        List five things you do not deserve but God gave you because of His grace. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> By His Grace We Are Saved <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nBaptists believe that the all-inclusive, most significant purpose and chief end of God's grace is our salvation. It is by the act of grace, through the death of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that every born again child of God receives newness of life as against a life of sin, self, death and hell. It is on this principle of grace that God released His only begotten Son and on the act of same grace that the Son voluntarily surrendered Himself to die on the cross. Baptists accept that faith is the means by which we encounter salvation. But ever before faith came into the picture, the act, virtue and quality that actualised it is grace. \"For it is by grace you have been save through faith __ and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.\" (Ephesians 2:8) \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Read and compare these two passages John 3:16 and Ephesians 2:8. \r\n        \r\n        <\/p><ol>\r\n        <li>Which of these two actually saved us, GRACE or LOVE?

Baptists are proud to identify with Paul in His conviction and declaration that \"...by the grace of God, I am what I am.\" (1 Corinthians 15:10). We believe that we were once dead in our trespasses, but as we \r\n            received God's grace we became alive in Him. God graciously lavishes on us the fruits of the Holy Spirit for us to grow into Christlikeness. We are also given charismatic gifts, spiritual gifts of grace, for building up His Church (Romans 12:6). Indeed, the conviction that has held us together over the years as Baptists has been \"we are what we are by His grace\". \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        There is a hidden note of warning in Paul's statement, \"\u2026and His grace to me was not without effect\" (1 Corinthians 15:10).

God's grace is simply God's unmerited favour towards us. We do not deserve it; we did nothing to earn it. Again, it is grounded in God's character. Because God is merciful and loving and gracious, He offers us salvation. He does not offer us His salvation because of who we are; He offers it to us because of who He is. That means that because of God's mercy He does not punish us the minute we sin, and because of His grace, He offers us forgiveness of sins, salvation from the penalty of sin and eternal life. It is the strong belief of Baptists to pattern their lives after Jesus' example by relating with God and fellow human beings on the basis of grace. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Give some examples of how Christians can relate with one another on the basis of grace in the context of employee-employer relationship (considering salary and emolument, hours of resumption, and hours of closing in the place of work).  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> In view of God's preference and act of dealing with man based on GRACE, rather than LAW; how will you describe a Christian who relates with God and man based on law (Exodus 20:8) rather than grace (Hebrews 10:25)? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":4,"title":"baptist belief about salvation","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> JANUARY: WEEK 4 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> BAPTIST BELIEF ABOUT SALVATION  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 192 <\/b>  Are You Washed in the Blood?  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>   John 1:1-15   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Explain the term `Salvation'.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Analyse the three stages of salvation. <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Formulate definition of salvation and evaluate the genuineness of their salvation experience. <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Case Study\r\n        <\/p> <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            A story was told of a man who was drowning as a result of a terrible storm at sea.

We believe that salvation is the redemption of the whole man and it is given to all who accept the offer of Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, who obtained eternal redemption for believers by His own blood. In its broadest sense, salvation includes regeneration, justification, sanctification and glorification. There is no \r\nsalvation outside personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. Our attention will be on this all-important gift that God lavished on mankind which cannot be earned by good works or obtained on the basis of human merit. A reminder of these salient issues about salvation as discussed below is needed for healthy life of the church and the benefit of the whole world. \r\n\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Conversion: A Gateway to Salvation <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            Baptists affirm the necessity of conversion for every person on earth. Conversion is a process by which humans are saved. It is a reversal from Satan's ways to embrace God. According to Baptists, conversion may seem to be gradual and systematic as seen in the experience of Timothy (1Timothy 1:3-6). It can also be dramatic and sudden as observed in the life of Saul who became Paul (Acts 9:1-6). Baptists regard the doctrine of conversion as highly important and as the only remedy for the spiritual condition of mankind who naturally inherited sin (Romans 5:19); was born a sinner (Psalm 51:5); became a sinner by choice (Isaiah 53:6) and got addicted to sin by practice (Ecclesiastes 7:20). Conversion into Christianity takes place at the point a penitent sinner makes a lifetime sincere commitment to trade off his sins in exchange for Christ's righteousness. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Which of the two kinds of conversion experience (gradual\/systematic or dramatic\/sudden) did you have?

This belief is predicated on biblical texts such as \"...by grace you have been saved\" (Ephesians 2:8); \"who has saved us and called us...\" (2 Timothy 1:9) and \"He saved ... He saved us through the washing...\" (Titus 3:5). The ground for this belief is based on the life and death of Christ, which happened at a fixed period in \r\nhistory (1 Timothy 1:15; Hebrews 2:10; 5:9; 12:2). Thus, the basis on which salvation is given is by the completed atoning work of Christ, though our experience of salvation is far from being finished. However, the fact remains that every born-again child of God appropriated Christ's death when he\/she believed in and confessed Jesus. Consequently, he\/she became justified having been rescued from the penalty of sin (death). Justification is the activity of God which liberates a person from the guilt of sin and imputes the righteousness of God to mankind. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        \"How are you working out your salvation is a complete work through the death of our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ, but its experience is far from being finished,\" Discuss.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Sanctification: Salvation as Present <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n Salvation, according to Baptists, is also viewed as a present action and an ongoing spiritual experience. Salvation is seen as a reality which keeps on unfolding even in the present time. Christians are referred to as people \"being saved\" (1Corinthians 1:18; 15:2; Romans 5:10). In Philippians 2:12, we are challenged to continue to \"work out (our) salvation\" which indicates a present continuous action. The crux of this view of salvation according to Baptists is that all Christians who are already saved by the death of Christ should endeavour to become all that Christ has purposed them to be through His life as they live according to God's design and purpose on a daily basis. This is practically experienced in the process of sanctification as they enjoy victory over the power of sin (temptations). Sanctification is the activity of God which liberates Christians from the power of sin and imparts the righteousness of God through man.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are you doing to work out your salvation with fear and trembling? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Glorification: Salvation as Future <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nAnother concept in the plan of salvation is our glorification. Baptists view glorification as the zenith of salvation and is the final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed. Salvation is God's act which will be completely and fully enjoyed in the future time. A few of such Scriptures which have led Baptists to hold this belief are: \"Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed\"; \"...and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him\"; \"... are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time\" (Romans 13:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:9; 2 Timothy 2:10; Hebrews 9:28; Philippians 1:6; Romans 5:9-11; 1 Peter 1:5). From the Scriptures above, this aspect of salvation is described as being nearer than when we first believed (Romans 13:11), that Christ is to bring it and that it is ready to be revealed at His second coming. It is the conviction of Baptists that this aspect of our salvation will be ultimately and practically enjoyed at the glorification at which time the sin the nature will be removed and the believer will be given a perfect body (Philippians 3:20-21).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Baptists believe in one salvation, which is revealed to us in three stages: past, present and future. Salvation as can be seen is \"the act of God in Christ, rescuing us from the penalty, power and presence of sin for the purpose of justification, sanctification and glorification.\" Therefore, as sinners, sin separates us from God and condemns us to eternity in hell. But God loves us and sent His only Son, Jesus, to die on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins. Through His death, burial and resurrection He defeated sin and death and made it possible for all who place their trust in Him to have their sins washed away and receive eternal life. All you have to do is repent, turn away from evil, believe in Jesus Christ and put your trust in Him today.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> While salvation is freely offered to all who will believe, what is the process whereby we become recipients of God's grace and become Christians? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> What do you think will happen if we turn down the gift of salvation?  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        <h4>ROAD MAP FOR DISCIPLES<\/h4>\r\n        <p> \r\n        Jude, in a bid to combat the heretical teachings ravaging the church in the first century of Christianity, felt the need to write and urge his readers \"to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints\".

As Christ's disciples, we must be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks us to account for our faith and practices (1 Peter 3:21), in line with the Scripture which is the final authority for our faith and practices.

When sin damaged God's image in man, God was gracious to man. He sent Jesus to restore that image which man lost. The full image and likeness of God is Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 4:4; Hebrews 1:3; Colossians 1:15). God's intention is to reproduce His character in man (Ephesians 4:22). Rick Warren said, `God's ultimate goal for your life on earth is not comfort, but character development.' The Fruit of the Spirit is a perfect picture of Christ`s character (Galatians 5:22-23).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        In this teaching and sharing moment, we shall consider the following characters of Jesus: \r\n         <\/p>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Love (Philippians 2:1b)  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n        One attribute of Jesus is love.

Jesus commands His disciples to love God, and their neighbours because that is the proof of their discipleship (John 13:35). The world thinks of love as a feeling which must be expressed even if moral principles are compromised. Valentine season's display of supposed love is an example of how many misunderstand love. The display of such love at this period is selfish, ungodly and lustful. However, the real love is in Christ, which is holy, just and perfect.

Paul, in our text, unveils the humility of Christ that resulted to glory. He also commands us to be humble (v.3). We must understand the humility of Christ for us to be humble. Paul explained Christ's humility in three parts: \r\n        <\/p><ul>\r\n        <li> Jesus did not exploit His divine nature. \"He had equal status with God but didn\\'t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what.\" (Philipians 2:6, THE MESSAGE). <\/li>\r\n        <li> Jesus became a man and died on the cross, \"...he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human!\" (Philippians 2:7, THE MESSAGE)  <\/li>\r\n        <li> Jesus died humiliatingly not ordinarily. \"Having become human... he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death and the worst kind of death at that: a crucifixion.\" (Philippians 2:8 THE MESSAGE). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n        \r\n        <p> Jesus taught His disciples humility when He washed their feet (John 13:1-17). This example is a lesson for us to have a servant's attitude and minister to one another. True humility is described in Philippians 2:1-11. Therefore, humility does not mean demeaning or thinking poorly of ourselves. Humility earns a disciple the favour of elevation before God.  <\/p>\r\n        \r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n         In what ways can we show humility? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Tenderness and Compassion (Philippians 2:1b; Colossians 3:12)  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n        Tenderness and compassion are other things. Jesus modelled to strengthen unity. Selfishness brings disunity and can ruin a church. Like Jesus, believers are to be tender and compassionate. When God appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai, He claimed as part of His title \"tenderness\" and \"compassion\". Tenderness has been defined as a tendency to express warm and affectionate feelings towards someone, soft heartedness that is concerned with the welfare of others. God said through Isaiah portraying His tenderness and compassion, \"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion\u2026 I will not forget you\" (Isaiah 49:15). Compassion was evoked in Jesus Himself, sometimes to the point of tears when He came face to face with pain, sorrow, hunger, loneliness and bewilderment in others (Matthew 9:36). He witnessed the grief of Lazarus' sisters. He wept with them (John 11:35). He showed compassion to the widow of Nain (Luke 7:13). Like Jesus, each disciple's intentional compassionate action contributes to the growth of spiritual transformation.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Two members should explain moments of tenderness and compassion they have experienced or witnessed. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Christlike character is what we need to demonstrate to bring about changes in our family, church, society, nation, and the entire world.

Today, we are learning more about Jesus'\r\nteachings from His Sermon on the Mount. Generally, Christ's teachings can be found in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. However, today's lesson is taken from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). Jesus taught in Matthew 5:43-48 that we should love our enemies. Jesus' authority in teaching when contrasted with that of the scribes is emphatic and explicit. His teachings called the hearers to make decision and commitment. We are to obey His teachings and make commitments.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Salt and Light (Matthew 5:13-16) <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nJesus said, \"You are...,\" not \"you should or you may\". This is a call to a new understanding of oneself. Salt and light model a disciple's true identity as opposed to decay and darkness. Since salt and light \r\nderive their functions from their nature, being has priority over saying and doing. It follows that what a person is will be expressed in what the person says or does. Jesus addresses the issue of identity here. Who are you? What Jesus says about your personality is more important than your view of low self-image. Jesus says disciples are the salt of the earth, the light of the world and a city set upon a hill. The symbols of salt and light assure people of their worth and call them to their mission. The point is that being determines function. While salt preserves and seasons; light shines and exposes. It is expected of Christ's disciples to influence the society by shining as light to a world that is morally decaying. God designed the church to consist of people who are \"called out\" from the world. We are to live consecrated lives.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How would someone with injury on his leg react if salt is put on it?

Adultery is a sin which begins deep within us in terms of feeling, impulse and intention. The problem of lust in human hearts leads to various sexual sins. It is obvious that Jesus is explaining not just the letter of the law on adultery but also the spirit of the law, the law's intent. It is not enough to avoid certain external sinful behaviours. We also need to honour God with our thoughts, our motives and our attitudes. Jesus' teaching does not say that sexuality is evil; its concern is in what is done with sexual desire. Sex should be brought under control. No person is to be reduced to just a sex object. Sex is a beautiful gift God gives to married couples. The church must create space for healthy discussions about sex. Whenever an adult is involved in extramarital affair with someone who is not his\/her spouse, it is adultery and it is a sin. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How will you share the Gospel with an adulterer? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Worry (Matthew 6:25-34)  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n         God wants us to trust Him and to have faith in Him always. Jesus said, \"If God cares so wonderfully for wild flowers \u2026He will certainly care for you\" (Matthew 6:30). We have to put God first in our lives and allow Him to fill our thoughts with His desires, take His character for our pattern and serve and obey Him in everything. Today, many people have replaced the position of God with people, objects, goals and other desires. Jesus said, \"... do not worry about tomorrow... (Matthew 6:34). Beloved, while planning for tomorrow is a time well spent, worrying about tomorrow is a time wasted. Careful planning is thinking ahead about goals, steps and schedules, and trusting in God's guidance. Planning can help alleviate worry. Worry by contrast steals our peace, physically wears us out, and can even make us sick. It makes us find it difficult to trust God. Therefore, we should not allow worries about tomorrow affect our relationship with God today. Remember, yesterday is a cancelled cheque, tomorrow is a promissory note, and today is all you've got. Rather than worry about things you can't change, it is better you pour all your worries upon Jesus because He cares for you.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Members should discuss the causes of worry? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        The teachings of Jesus are central to different aspects of relationship.

Today, we are considering His power.\r\n        Dictionaries define the word `Power' in a number of ways but our focus is power as ability to act or produce an effect. Jesus told His disciples that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on them (Acts 1:8). The power to be a witness of the Gospel was important after their training in order to continue with the Great Commission. It is more of God's power in the life of a believer that is needed to fulfil His divine purpose. A believer will live a fulfilled life if he lives by God's power. Jesus declared to His disciples that all power in heaven and on earth has been given to Him (Matthew 28:19, KJV). Let us examine some acts of God\\'s power. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Understanding Jesus' Power <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nPower is the control that some people search for in life. Some talk about the power a personality commands. Others talk about the power of various objects or systems in this world. Few talk about the power of God. The life of Jesus was characterised by supernatural power with which He was endued from above. He said, \"All power in heaven and on earth is given to me\" (Matthew 28:18 NCV). The Scripture shows that Jesus had power in Him; that when He healed, power went out from Him. The power that surrounded Jesus was supernatural, not normal physical or natural power. Let us think about this power for a short moment. This power was given to Jesus not for Him to use it for Himself. You will remember that He refused to turn stones into bread, that He would not use power for public acclamation, etc. It was to enable Jesus to do God's will. The power did not die with Jesus. He said after His resurrection that the power is available for His disciples to be His witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8 NIV). And like Jesus, divine power was used to equip the disciples to do God's will. They trusted in Jesus' power to expand God's kingdom. Indeed the apostles endured hardship, troubles and deaths by the divine power. It is power that is at its strongest when we are weak in ourselves and rely on Him. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Let a member share how God's power encouraged him\/her during persecution or hardship.\r\n<\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> What Jesus' Power Conveys to the Disciples  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <b> Jesus' power is made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12: 9-10)<\/b>\r\n            <p>\r\n            In response to Paul's prayer, Jesus said, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness\u2026\" (vv. 9-10). Four words in verse 10 help us to understand the kind of weakness Paul was referring to in this passage: insults, hardships, persecutions and difficulties. Weakness here is not a sin but circumstances, situations, experiences and wounds that makes us weak and weary. \r\n            <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <b>  Jesus' power over death (John 10:17-18) <\/b>\r\n        <p> Jesus is powerful. He raised the following people from death: Jairus' daughter (Mark 5:35-43), the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7: 14-15), Lazarus the brother of Mary and Martha (John 11:43-44). He finally laid down His life and took it up again with His own power. He rose from the grave to eternal life, just like believers will receive life over death through the power of Jesus.  <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <b>Jesus' power over sin (Matthew 9:6; Luke 5:24) <\/b>\r\n        <p>There is no one who can forgive sin except God. Jesus forgives sins because He has power to do so. Jesus has power to heal sicknesses, cast out unclean spirits, execute judgment, etc. He is the head of all principalities and powers. He gave power to His disciples against unclean spirits (Luke 9:1-2). Jesus will come again with power (Matthew 24:30; Mark 13:26). Jesus gives His disciples power to become sons of God (John 1:12-13). The power of Jesus which is a gift to all believers is limitless. The power of God is calling you today to salvation, believe in Jesus' saving power, be cleansed from all your sins, be forgiven and receive eternal life.  <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Members should differentiate between man's power and Jesus' power. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Getting God's Power <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are different kinds of power but Christ's power is greater than all of them. Paul said, \"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power\" (1 Corinthians 4:20). God's power is able to do more than believers can imagine (Ephesians 3:20). But the pertinent question is how believers get God's power. Rick Warren in his message, `Get God's Power,' presented three ways a believer can get the power of God namely: by praying, because prayer and power go together; by taking risks to obey God even when it doesn't make sense to anybody, because God will pour His power on any one that takes risks to obey him. Abraham, Noah and Paul were examples. Lastly, believers must persist and should not give up until they get the power.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Members should mention other ways believers can get the power of Jesus. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Do we rely on our own power for God's work or on His Power? Do we rely on the power of God to change and transform us and to enable us to be used by God? The productivity is not ours but God's. We must absolutely rely on His power and daily ask for more of His power from above. Disciples of Jesus need more of His power in their lives. We are to depend on the Holy Spirit to get the power to pray, to take risks to obey God and refuse to give up.

Our final discussion is on Jesus' saving grace. Saving grace refers to God's grace to lead a person to salvation. This assertion is based on a variety of biblical principles that emphasise salvation as free gift of God's grace rather than something that a person earns through good deeds and actions. No level of human accomplishments is good enough to obtain salvation. The only way to receive God's saving grace is through faith in Christ (Isaiah 64:6; Ephesians2: 8-9). \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  Sister Ngozi Erekosima: What Is Grace?

Grace is Christ's unmerited favour, an undeserved goodness. Christ's saving grace is  \t\r\n\r\nthe grace of God that saves a person from sin and guilt. Jesus Christ Himself is our saving grace. The only way believers were declared righteous was by the provision of salvation for them through grace apart from works. Jesus' death on the cross is what saves us, not our own merit (Ephesians 2:9). No one receives a gift from someone and asks how much he should pay because it is a gift. The simple response to a gift is `thank you'. In the same way, the Christians' response to the saving grace of God that brought salvation should be gratitude, praise and joy because (a) Christ's saving grace extends to all men (Titus 2:11; 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 33:11); (b) Christ's saving grace extends even to those who reject it and ultimately perish (Matthew 23:37; 2 Peter 2:1). From these passages and others, Jesus' saving grace is serious and efficacious. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Let members demonstrate how they will explain Jesus' saving grace to their neighbours who are not Christians. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Deaconess Miriam Ayuba: The Saving Grace Versus Cheap Grace <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are some people who advocate a form of grace that is called \"cheap grace\" that is different from <b>saving grace<\/b>. Cheap grace argues that grace alone is responsible for everything and so a person does not have to change. They can continue to live in sin and they will not face any consequences. To proponents of cheap grace, the sins are justified but the person is not and so continues to live in sin. They view God's love and forgiveness of sins as a general truth and not as life transforming agents. Saving grace (which is biblical) proponents agree that grace alone, Christ alone, and faith alone are sufficient (Ephesians 2:8-9). Saving grace requires a change in lifestyle. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Deacon Ore-Ofe Oluwatomigba: The Seven Lessons of the Saving Grace (Titus 2: 11-13)  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nJesus' saving grace teaches the following lessons according to Dake's Annotated Reference Bible: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li>To deny ungodliness (v. 12)  <\/li>\r\n<li>To deny worldly lusts (v. 12) <\/li>\r\n<li>To live soberly (v. 12; 1:8; 2:2-7)  <\/li>\r\n<li>To live righteously (v. 12; Hebrews 12:14; Romans 6:14-23; 8:12-13) <\/li>\r\n<li>To live godly (v. 12; 2 Timothy 3:12)  <\/li>\r\n<li>To live right in this life (v 12)  <\/li>\r\n<li>To look for the rapture and the Second Advent (v. 13; Philippians 3:20).  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Members should mention and discuss worldly lusts they must deny. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Dr Mrs Favour: The Results of Saving Grace (Titus 2:11-14) <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n One of the results of saving grace is sanctification. Wayne Grudem said, `Sanctification is a progressive work of God and man that makes us more and more free from sin and be like Christ in our actual lives'. Another result of Christ's saving grace is that it removes the Christian from future punishment in eternity and separation from God. It is a great blessing for condemned sinners to be saved and be with Jesus in paradise. This reminds us of three great benefits from the Life Application Study Bible that believers anticipate when Christ returns: Christ personal presence (believers look forward to being with Him), redemption from sinful desire (Christians long for the end of the battle with sin and believers' perfection in Christ), restoration of creation (Christians anticipate the complete rule of grace when the image of God will be fully realised in people and when the created order will be restored).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Let members explain what sanctification means to them. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 4 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Christ saving grace saves. It is God's mercy shown to believers. Everyone who is permitted to enter heaven will be there by grace. The teachings of Irvin Himme (Truth Magazine, December1973) on the grace of God, reminds Christians that Jesus' saving grace does not: i. circumvent Jesus Christ, ii. ignore the gospel, iii. permit access apart by faith, iv. rule against baptism for the remission of sins, v. give licence to sin, vi. offer \r\n        unconditional security, and, vii. does not save on the basis of human merit. God's indwelling grace is active. It leads you and influences you. It brings change to you and within you. The grace that results in salvation should continue to have a profound effect upon our hearts. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>  Let members read the first stanza of the hymn, `Amazing Grace', and explain what it means to them.  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li>  Members should differentiate between cheap grace and the saving grace. <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <li>  Mention at least four lessons that Jesus' saving grace teaches.  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        <h4> ROAD MAP FOR DISCIPLES <\/h4>\r\n        <p>Every disciple should desire to know more about Jesus through relationship. Relationship with Jesus helps believers to know Him better, to love and obey Him. No disciple should ever be satisfied with his level of knowing Jesus. Christlike discipleship is a lifelong relationship of knowing more of Jesus. When last did you do self examination of your relationship with Christ? Do you study the Bible every day? Do you pray always in the name of Jesus? What about your time alone with God? What about your church prayer fellowship and discipleship training course? When you have relationship with Jesus' you will desire fellowship with Him always. You know Jesus more and more as you have constant fellowship with Him.<\/p>\r\n        <p> As disciples of Jesus Christ, we have considered four lessons relating to knowing more about Jesus' character, teachings, power and saving grace. Christlike character is the ultimate goal of all Christian education. Do people see the character of Jesus __ love, humility, tenderness and compassion __ in your life? Christ teachings personally touch life, culture, traditions and societies. Jesus in His teachings demands obedience and commitment from His hearers. Are you committed to obeying Jesus' teachings? A believer will live a fulfilled life if he lives by the power of Jesus. Are you on track? Are you praying to get more of Jesus' power, ready to take risks to obey God even when it doesn't make sense to you? Have you been saved by His grace? Don't forget these teachings as Christ's disciples. Obey them as to make a difference for Christ in this generation. <\/p><\/p>"},{"id":9,"title":"simon of cyrene and joseph of arimathea","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> MARCH WEEK 1 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> SIMON OF CYRENE AND JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 99 <\/b> When I Survey the Wondrous Cross  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>  Matthew 27:32; Luke 23:50-56   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Examine the role Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea played in the Easter narratives.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Apply same in their daily walk with God.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Opinion Sharing\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            Let one member of the class share how he\/she felt after rendering assistance to the needy. \r\n         <\/p> <!-- MESSAGE  1 -->\r\n                    \r\n        <h4>Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks<\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        It is a good habit to render help to someone who is in need. However,\r\n\r\nit is not always possible to help someone especially when such an\r\n\r\nindividual is responsible for his troubles. Ideally, rendering help is at its best when it is done willingly, without coercion. Our lesson today reveals two men in the Easter narratives who rendered assistance to Jesus. One of them, Simon of Cyrene, was forced by soldiers to carry the cross of Jesus. The cross was a negative social symbol, an emblem of suffering and shame. Someone carrying a cross is not likely to get assistance or attract sympathy, but is solely an individual responsibility. The other, Joseph of Arimathea, offered his tomb voluntarily for the body of Jesus to be buried. In seeking the good of others, Joseph gave his tomb, his convenience, and risks his class or status in exchange for shame.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Simon's Identity and Personality Matthew 27:32  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>Simon is a Greek personal name which means, \"flat-nosed.\" It is used in the New Testament as Greek alternative of the Hebrew word for \"Simeon.\" <\/li>\r\n        <li>He was from Cyrene, a city located in northern Africa where modern Libya is now located (Hale, 281).

The compelling nature of this service is buttressed in the synoptic accounts. Matthew and Mark in their narratives use the verb \"forced \"or \"compelled\" while Luke, on the other hand uses the verb \"seized.\" By implication, the soldiers forced, compelled, or seized Simon to help carry the cross that brought salvation to the human race. Considering the weight of the cross and torture Jesus went through in their hands and being afraid that Jesus may likely die on the way before reaching the place of His execution, they forced Simon to lend a helping hand to Jesus by carrying His cross. Simon of Cyrene actually did for Jesus what one of His disciples should have done for Him at that hour, if they had not deserted Him when arrested. God brought this man from Africa to render help to Jesus in the hour of His greatest need.\r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What will God do if we fail to render assistance to someone who needs it? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Joseph's Identity and Personality Luke 23:50-56  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n         <ol> \r\n         <li>  Joseph was a wealthy Jew who came from Arimathea in Judea (Luke 23:51). <\/li>\r\n         <li>  He was a good and righteous man and a member of the Council (the Sanhedrin). <\/li>\r\n         <li>  He was a biblical figure who played an important role in the burial of Jesus Christ.

They do this as a deterrent to others. But according to Jewish law, it was necessary to bury the body of a person on the day he died (Deuteronomy 21:22-23).

We are also challenged to lay down our lives for others. Jesus laid down His life for others; we are also called to die to self, pride and selfish ambition. Let each man seek the good of others first. Joseph gave up his tomb, his convenience, his class and he identified with shame instead of honour. God can place us where we will be available for Him to use, to be of help to someone who is in need. Simon became available by carrying the cross of Jesus. How available are you in the hands of God to meet that felt need in the life of that fellow around you? <\/li>\r\n        <li> SERVICE: Jesus did not resist Simon of Cyrene from helping Him to carry the heavy cross. It shows that Jesus must have looked forward to such help because He was exhausted. Inwardly, Jesus must have appreciated the fine gesture of Simon of Cyrene for helping Him to carry the cross to Golgotha. God needs true service like the one by Simon of Cyrene. When we share the burdens of others and the world around us and carry them to God in prayers, it is like \"helping\" Jesus to carry His cross. God appreciates those whose heartbeat is for the salvation of the lost souls in the world. <\/li>\r\n        <li> LOVE: Love is the compelling force for service. Simon and Joseph loved Jesus. They must have felt pity for Jesus because of the suffering and torture he bore for the sins of humanity. Their spirits and souls must have compelled them to show such concern for their Saviour because they loved Him. If you are a child of God, you should and must allow the love of God to compel you to do that which would have been naturally impossible to do (2 Corinthians 5:14). It is possible that where you are now, God keeps you there for His divine purpose. Simon and Joseph served the purpose of God in Jesus\\' life; what about you? <\/li>\r\n        <li> GENEROSITY: Generosity in giving is often a response to gratitude in receiving.

The prophecy in Isaiah 54:12 which says, \"Therefore, I will divide him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with transgressors. For he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors\" was fulfilled in the story of our Lord Jesus\\' crucifixion on the cross at Calvary. The prophecy gives the background to the understanding of our lesson today. Isaiah\\'s prediction on Christ\\'s humiliation and exaltation is fulfilled in Jesus\\' crucifixion especially his identification with the criminals. These men had contact with Jesus, played vital roles and become part of the Easter story. Their contributions authenticate biblical prophecy. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Jesus' Identification with the Criminals <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nRobbers are inimical to any family and society. They constitute social threat to human life and property and create security challenge to the government. No normal person in any society will like to be related to robbers because they bring reproach to the family and the community. Yet, it was amidst these criminals that Jesus found Himself at the cross. For our sins, He was numbered among them. Furthermore, the presence of the robbers that were crucified alongside Jesus symbolises His identification with humans. Jesus bore the reproach that was due to man. The implication here is that Christ suffered the shame that was due to us. Jesus suffered with vilest malefactors as if He had been a partaker with them in their sins. He was numbered among the transgressors at His death, that we at our death might be numbered among the living in Christ. He is our life. He came to give us life in abundance. Also, Jesus was crucified in between these notorious criminals, as if he had been the worst of the three, the principal malefactor, for the middle was considered the place for the chief of them all. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> The Responses of the Criminals to Jesus <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nLuke\\'s Gospel says that one of the criminals, \"who hung there hurled insults at him. Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\" This shows how wicked a sinful man\\'s heart can be. The hour of death is not a time to create more trouble for oneself but a time of sober reflection and reconciliation with God and man. This could be the reason the other criminal in response, rebuked his partner in crime on the basis that the hour of death is hardly the appropriate moment for an evildoer like him to insult an innocent man like Jesus. The negative response of the wicked criminal to Jesus at the cross resulted to his physical and spiritual judgment and damnation. On the contrary, the remorseful robber realised that he was a sinner and appealed to Jesus for mercy. He pleaded with Jesus not to forget him when He entered His kingdom. No truly penitent sinner will be in Jesus\\' presence without encountering the holiness of God and the grace that can transform his life. Jesus granted the criminal\\'s request. He told the repentant thief, \"Today you will be with me in paradise.\" What a joy! The thief only suffered Romans\\' judgment for over his  \t\r\n\r\ncrime but through the Saviour, he passed from death unto life eternal. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Implications of Jesus' Identification with the Criminals  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n            <ol>\r\n            <li>  Jesus came to save the vilest sinner; He gave His life on the cross for one of the robbers.

To the unsaved whose heart is far from God, like the second robber, change your mind by turning towards Christ before it is too late. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Assess your response to Jesus and the cross at this season. <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li>  Preach the message of the cross to a sinner. <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":11,"title":"mary, the mother of jesus and the other mary ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> MARCH WEEK 3 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3>MARY, THE MOTHER OF JESUS AND THE OTHER MARY  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 97 <\/b>  Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>  Matthew 28:1-10   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, class members should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Describe the roles played by Mary, the mother of Jesus and the other Mary in Easter narratives.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Apply same in their daily walk with God.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Opinion Sharing\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            Should Mary the mother of Jesus Christ be worshipped or honoured? \r\n         <\/p> <!-- MESSAGE  1 -->\r\n                    \r\n        <h4>Facilitator's Opening Remarks<\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        Some Christian groups worship Mary and even pray to God through her. Their reason for the worship is based on the role that Mary played in history, especially during the birth of Christ. God was in her womb. In conceiving and bearing the Lord Jesus Christ, she gave birth not to mere man but to the Son of God Himself. In respect to this they claim, Mary deserves to be worshipped. Furthermore, this same group claims that Mary remained a virgin after the birth of Christ and that Jesus\\' brothers and sisters mentioned in Matthew 13:55-56; Mark 6:3 were either Joseph\\'s children by an earlier marriage or were cousins of Jesus. On the other hand, some other Christian groups argue that Mary is not an object of worship and even neglect her and her contributions in the Easter narrative. Inasmuch as the Bible does not teach or present Mary as an object of worship, it does present her as a woman of high character and faith. Consequently, Mary should be accorded the respect and recognition due to her among Christians. Our lesson this week focuses on the roles that Mary the mother of Jesus and the other Mary played in the Easter story. What can be said of them that are consistent with the Holy Scripture? Moreover, what character traits can be emulated from them that could spur us to be more committed to God and His service on earth? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Mary, the Mother of Jesus  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nWe do not have much information about the background of Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, Luke introduced Mary, in his gospel as a woman of high character and faith (Luke 1:26-38). She probably resided in Nazareth a town in Galilee where she received an angelic visitation. Mary was a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David (Luke 1:26-27). Out of God\\'s grace, Mary became the mother of Jesus Christ on earth. (Luke 1:26-38). The text only mentioned one relative of Mary called Elizabeth, the wife of Zechariah (Luke1:39) who resided in Hebron. The latter was also favoured with God\\'s blessing of the womb after so many years of barrenness (Luke 1:36-37). At crucifixion, where Christ, almost with His last words, commends His mother the care of the disciple whom He loved, Mary was taken into his home (John 19:25-27).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What is the role of character in the practice of faith? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>  Her Character <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <ol>\r\n        \r\n        <li>  <b>A woman of high moral standard.<\/b> The Bible records that Mary was a virgin (Luke1:27).

She was said to have been possessed by seven demons (v. 2). This ministration brought Mary Magdalene, Salome and Mary, the mother of James and John into companionship (Mark 15:40), and also with Mary the mother of the Lord (John 19:25), \"stood at a distance, watching these things\" (Luke 23:41), during the closing hours of Christ\\'s agony on the cross.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What noteworthy service have you done for the Lord? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> The Women's Roles at Easter Narratives and their Implications  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n            <ol>\r\n            <li>  Discipleship. The women were disciples of Christ who not only followed Jesus by placing their faith in Him, but have physically and faithfully followed Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem where He was crucified and buried (Luke 23:55; Matthew 27:61; Mark 15:47). They remained by the cross till Jesus\\' death and they waited till the body was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea (Luke 23:55). Christians are also called to be disciples of Christ in faith and practice (Luke 9:23). In other to do this, we must give up self interest and disobedience (Romans 6:17). <\/li>\r\n            <li>  Service. They did not only follow Jesus, they cared for Him (Mark 15:40-41). Even at death, they cared for Jesus (Mark 16:1; Matthew 28:1. 5; Mark 16:2, 5). Christians should therefore use whatever is at their disposal to serve the Lord and humanity. Such kind of service goes a long way in meeting people\\'s needs. <\/li>\r\n            <li> Empathy. Mary Magdalene with other women went to the tomb to anoint the body of Jesus (Mark 16:1-5) and ran to Peter and John to inform them that the stone had been rolled away from the mouth of the tomb of Jesus (Luke 24:10; John 20:1-2). Likewise, Christians are to empathise with the poor, marginalised, persecuted and oppressed people of the world.  <\/li>\r\n            <li> Evangelism. When they met the resurrected Lord, the women spread the news abroad (Matthew 28:8). Easter is a time of proclamation of Christ\\'s love and sacrifice to humankind. Let us go to set the captives free and raise-up the dead (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8). <\/li>\r\n            <\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What other roles do these women perform at Easter? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 4 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        From the two characters, we have studied thus far; we discovered that, living a godly life attracts God\\'s blessings.

It is a favour to be called a child of God. This identity with Christ is \r\n        predicated on Christ\\'s love. He is the lover of our souls. He did not only love us but He suffered and died for us. He sacrificed His life on the cross of Calvary so as to redeem us from the bondage of sin and death. He who knew no sin became sin so that we might become the righteous ones of God. He offered His body as a ransom for all who exercise faith in Him as their Saviour. He shed His blood in order to cleanse us from all contaminations. He protects us even when we experience the storms of life. However, Christ\\'s love demands responsibility. He wants us to demonstrate or reciprocate that love to Him and to others. Our lesson this week focuses on the disciple Jesus loved and how Jesus demanded from him to reciprocate same to His mother. How will you reciprocate Christ\\'s love to you in this season?\r\n\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  The Personality of the Beloved Disciple <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n        The statement \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" is mentioned three times in John\\'s gospel (13:23; 19:26; 20:2). The first mention was when Jesus predicted His betrayal in John 13:23. He was described as one that was reclining next to Jesus. He enjoyed the closest relationship with Jesus; therefore Peter told John to ask Jesus which of the disciples would be the betrayer. The second mention was at the cross, when Jesus was about dying (19:26). At this juncture, Jesus saddled John with a responsibility of caring for His mother. The third mention was in John 20:2, where Mary Magdalene ran to Peter and this disciple and informed them of the empty tomb. Who is this disciple that Jesus loved? It is true that the name of this disciple is not mentioned. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that this disciple whom Jesus loved is John, the apostle, who wrote the Gospel according to John. And this John was the son of Zebedee. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Discuss why the disciple chose the designation \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" instead of his real name, John. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> The Privilege: Christ's Love <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nJohn enjoyed the love of Christ during Jesus\\' earthly ministry. This love is seen in diverse ways: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li> He was called to become a disciple (Luke 6:12-16).  <\/li>\r\n<li> He had a special place he stayed when the disciples assembled for supper (John 13:23).  <\/li>\r\n<li>  He was among the inner circle of Jesus (Matthew 26:37). <\/li>\r\n<li>  He witnessed the transfiguration of Jesus, (Matthew 17:1-3).  <\/li>\r\n<li> He outlived other disciples on earth (John 21:22-23).  <\/li>\r\n<li>  He received the revelation of Jesus Christ (Revelation 1:1).<\/li>\r\n<p> In summary, Jesus and John were essentially \"best of friends\".

He said, `Dear woman, here is your son\\'. By implication, John was to be like a biological son of Mary and was to care for her. From this we can surmise that Jesus\\' father, Joseph had probably died; otherwise he would have been the one responsible for his wife. Again, Jesus did not place this responsibility on His brothers (John 7:5; Acts 1:14) rather, He requested John to care for His mother. From that day on, John took responsibility for her, as if he were her own son. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Why did Jesus not place the care of His mother on His brothers?

As you have meditatively gone through the lessons each week, are you sensitive to the voice and move of God\\'s Spirit and release yourself for service? This month, our focus has been on some characters who played vital roles in the Easter narratives. Simon of Cyrene and Joseph of Arimathea offered their services to Jesus; the two criminals on the cross responded to Jesus differently while one rejected Jesus the other accepted Him. We also looked at women disciples, Mary the mother of Jesus and the other Mary who demonstrated empathy, service and commitment to Jesus on His way to the cross. Finally, we learnt of \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\"; whose privileges attracted responsibility from his Master. The essence of the character study is to challenge us to make ourselves available to God so as to be used for His glory and for the blessings of others who God will bring our way. Are you ready for His service? Are you willing to do the will of your Lord this season?

Yes, it does, or you would not be here. You are unique. You are different from anyone else. The great Creator, God, personally designed and made you that way. In God\\'s master plan, everyone is created with many things in common with everyone else. Yet each person is distinct from any other human being. God had a vision prepared and outlined for mankind. It is the offering of and the way to eternal life in the kingdom of God: \"That whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\" (John 3:15). \"They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God\" (Luke 13:29). You have been called. Will you act to fulfil God\\'s vision for you? Those called are invited to be living examples of a better way, a richer and fuller life. You are called to the joy of sharing God\\'s vision for mankind with others, a pace-setter in high moral values and conduct, in physical \r\n        and spiritual integrity. You are called to leadership through service, called to sonship (John 1:12). While still in this life, your duty is \"by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service\" (Romans 12:1). Wherever you are, work everyday to be the best person you can be, doing the best you can do with all you have to do it, to the glory of God. Yes, this is your destiny in God\\'s glorious vision for mankind. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        \"God\\'s vision, our mission,\" Discuss. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Man Lost the Glorious Vision, Jesus Reclaims It <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nMan is the unique creation of God, made in His own image (Genesis 1:27). He created them male and female as the crowning work of His creation. At creation, Man was sinless and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice. God\\'s vision for Man was to be innocent of sin. By his free choice, Man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. Man damaged the glorious vision of God through sin. Through yielding to the temptation of Satan, Man transgressed the law of God, and fell from his original innocence whereby his posterity inherits a nature and an environment inclined towards sin. Only the grace of God can bring Man into His holy fellowship and enable him to fulfill the creative vision of God. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>The Bible says Jesus died as a propitiation for our sins. Simply put, that means that on the cross, Jesus died to satisfy the just demands of God against sin. Because God loved us and knew that we could not pay that debt ourselves, He gave of Himself and sent His Son to pay the debt for mankind. We owed a debt we could not pay, and Jesus died to pay a debt He did not owe. The Bible says we are all sinners and that the wages of sin is death (Romans 3:23). Because Jesus lived a sinless life, He was an acceptable sacrifice for our sins.

Mankind fell from grace to grass by his own choice. Sin separates Man from God and condemns us to eternity in hell. God loves us and sends His only Son, Jesus to die on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins.

In fact, at the onset of His ministry, He was faced with the temptation to change the focus of His vision. Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13 provide the account of the temptation that confronted Jesus. He had the option to choose between being a political or economic messiah, but He rejected it because it was His choice to make. That Jesus Christ eventually chose the narrow path of pain and death was not cheap or easy for him. However, He decided to endure the pain, which led to His eventual glorification. Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, victory over death and sin were won.

Vision is what must be birthed with determination and purpose, those without vision spend their lives taking the path of least resistance as they try to avoid discomfort. However, if a vision can effectively be pictured and transmitted, many are likely to adopt and follow the vision. \r\n        <b> The broad vision for the Church is seen in the Great Commission to \"go into all the world and make disciples of all nations...

It is for those who went before us and for those who are yet to be born.\" P. K. Bernard corroborates this assertion by affirming that, \"A man without a vision is a man without a future.\" A man without a future will always return to his past. Proverb 29: 18 states: \"Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, but happy is he who keeps the law.\" (NASU) \r\n         \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        No wonder Paul encourages the Christians at Ephesus to use their God-given gifts to work in unity to facilitate achieving the vision of expanding God\\'s kingdom on earth (Ephesians 4:1-12).

Before their very eyes they watched Him ascend into heaven (Acts 1:9-11). However, His going did not result in shattered dreams. At last they had caught the vision to be His witnesses; to go and make disciples of all nations. When they caught the vision the disciples became more disciplined. We can therefore say that vision produces discipline. The disciples waited in Jerusalem for about forty days ready to receive the Holy Spirit which eventually came on them. Then they were ready to move out to carry out Jesus\\' assignment. As Jesus\\' disciples today, we are to catch the vision and then move ahead to continue where the early disciples had stopped. For those who have the Kingdom vision and are on mission field, for those controlled by the Holy Spirit that ignites an unquenchable passion for expanding God\\'s glory, we must get beyond our religious traditions and embrace the vision to expand the kingdom of God. It does not matter our denominational persuasions or how, where, and when we fellowship; it is about our spirit\\'s yearning to surrender everything for the Kingdom\\'s expansion. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What fruit is your ministry bearing for God\\'s glory? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Changed Lives <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nNotice that the disciples\\' lives had changed because of vision of the commission to go into the world and make disciples of nations.

Then your will and determination combined with the power of the Holy Spirit and God\\'s Word will produce a force that nothing can stop. Nothing short of a radically transformed life-changing allegiance from Satan to God, death to life, flesh to the Spirit, sin to obedience, the world to the Kingdom brings glory to God. Genuine transformation results in an unquenchable passion for God and fellow man that leads to service in love.

Where the leader cannot be trusted with godly desires, the followers will hesitate to give overwhelming support to any ideas being initiated. In the same vein, where the team or group members are engaging in ungodly lifestyles or behaviour, they will find it hard to separate carnal from spiritual matters (1 Corinthians 3:1-3). <\/li>\r\n<li> Being susceptible to demonic influences: Christians are spiritual beings and must be spiritually sensitive in their reactions on all occasions. The Church of Jesus Christ is a spiritual community and should be administered in a manner that is clearly different from the worldly or secular system. Any person can be used by the devil to hinder the progress and obstruct the pathway to peace and success, even without the person knowing (cf. Matthew 16:21-23). Therefore, it is suggested that Christians should jealously guard and guide the good deposits and investments God has put in their charge.  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What must you do to catch God\\'s glorious vision?\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Tips for Avoiding `Vision Killers' and Embrace `Vision Sustainers' <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nLife is full of distractions, therefore, it is important that Christian leaders and followers be determined to distinguish themselves at all times from those who are irresponsible.

The adage, \"Show me your friend, and I will tell who you are\", is forever relevant. <\/li>\r\n<li> Be preoccupied with only heavenly matters: The desire to prosper by worldly standard can become a snare believers (1Timothy 6:4-8). Engage in daily assessment of your vision and dreams to be sure they are driving you towards pursuing eternal goals only. <\/li>\r\n<li> To become a successful Christian, you must be aware of certain people in your life that have the tendency and potential to contribute to your desire to be all you can be in life, embrace such vision sustainer. <\/li>\r\n<li> To follow your dream and vision as a Christian, you must begin to identify members of your family and relatives who help your desire and dreams. They are people who encourage you to perform well and even support you spiritually, morally, and sometimes financially.

Leadership has been variously defined. It is the ability to coordinate major activities of a group or organisation toward achieving its main objectives. According to Warren Bennis (1990) in \"Managing the Dream: Training Leadership in the 21st Century\" (The Magazine of Human Resource Development), \"All leaders have the capacity to create a compelling vision: one that takes people to a new place; and the ability to translate that vision into reality.\" Today\\'s discussion focuses on how a leader can work to actualise the vision of the Church or related organisation for kingdom expansion. Kris Vallotton in his article on The Power of Vision wrote: \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n\r\n        <p> Vision is what we see, but it is also the way in which we see. Vision is the lens that interprets the events of our life, the way we view people and our concept of God. If we have a scratch on our glasses, it may seem like everybody around us has scratches too, but the problem actually lies with us because our vision is impaired. Jesus said that our eyes are the windows of our heart. Paul prayed that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened. In other words, we perceive with our eyes but we see with our hearts. Our minds receive images from our eyes but our heart interprets these images. If our heart becomes bitter, jealous, hurt or in some way infected, the lens of our heart is distorted. \r\n        <\/p>        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are ways to show that you are living with a sense of purpose? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>  Process of Actualising Vision for Kingdom Expansion <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nCertain steps are needed to be taken by the Church or team leaders in order to actualise godly vision, among which are: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li> <b>Discuss your vision with people.<\/b> Tell team members what you are thinking. Give them your big picture. Then, listen to see if other people are concerned about the same things. See if people are \r\ninterested in your picture of how things could be. The more you talk to people and listen to them, the clearer your vision will become. \r\n <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Develop and communicate the details.<\/b> After you have tested and reshape your vision, you need to carefully work out the details. You need to give people some specifics as to what and how the vision can positively impact their lives. You also have to tell the group what steps you will take to reach the goal. Some people may view your vision as being useless until they understood some details about the likely benefits they will derive from its actualisation.  <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Help people to own the vision.<\/b> This certainly will require some efforts, but it is worth the pains. People don\\'t need to agree with all the details of your vision in order to follow your lead. They will have different ideas about how to realise a vision; that is fine and healthy. But in order to work together, people need to share an overall vision and some basic goals.  <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Be optimistic and persuasive.<\/b> It takes courage to communicate a vision of what things shall be in the future. Often, it is only courageous people who see what is wrong with the implementation of a vision that successfully persuade group members about how to make necessary adjustments that new vision demands. Hence, a leader needs courage and optimism in the face of confusion and distraught. <\/li>\r\n<li>  <b>Be creative but consistent.<\/b> Godly leadership requires commitment and trust by the followers.

However, some practical steps can be taken, among which are listed below: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li>  <b>Know your organisation: <\/b>People are the same everywhere, but their experiences and backgrounds can make them to behave differently. During the initial phase of formulating a vision, it is important to intentionally study to know many things about the Church or related organisation as it currently exists. In actual sense, much cannot be achieved where the leader fails to intentionally undertake a study about the history and current situation of the Church or organisation <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Involve critical individuals:<\/b> The leader should plan to engage the support of some individuals or groups who are identified as being most critical to the Church or organisation. These `critical\\' individuals can be those who are considered important, especially based on their previous records of (either positive or negative) contributions. These may be representatives of major groups in the church, especially the vocal ones. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Explore the possibilities:<\/b> In all instances, the vision shall attract possible changes in the spiritual, economic and social lives of the members. Thus, certain specific questions should be asked, among which are: 1) what are possible future trends of members\\' needs? 2) What are the possible future expectations or requirements of team members? 3) What possible changes in the social, economic, political, or technical areas will impact the organisation? <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>Put the vision in writing:<\/b> The final step is the writing of a clear and concise `Vision Statement.\\' This step requires the need to use all the information gathered from the discussions with various individuals and groups about the descriptions of the future plans as well as the intended developments and trends that will impact the church or related organisation. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What elements are necessary for successful achievement of vision in this generation? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        To be a visionary person is to be the origin of something unique, original and groundbreaking.

A vision is important in all aspects of life; physical, emotional or corporate. Building your vision does not have to be difficult as long as you know exactly what you see for yourself in the future. Proverbs 29:18 provides information on the benefits of having vision. Among others, vision sharpens focus as it helps a man to labour with the desire to achieve progress. Vision also connects people to those who will become a source of blessing. In Acts 15:7-11, Peter readily supported the need to allow Gentiles to freely practise Christianity without any hindrance from Jewish leaders. That was not until he himself had been persuaded and prevailed upon through a vision from God (Acts 10:9-24). In today\\'s discourse, we shall consider some benefits of having viable vision. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> The Need for Having Vision <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nToday in Nigeria, as a result of bad models in the political arena and sometimes in the Church, some young persons have been wrongly influenced to believe in `rich quick\\' syndrome. Money rituals or other corrupt practices are rampant. Such experiences can only be stopped by godly leaders in churches or related organisations. The greatest antidote is by leading church members to pursue the vision of eternity. All that the Church does should be geared toward actualising the vision of saving human souls; bringing persons to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ regardless of their colour, gender or socio-economic status. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\nHuman life is fraught with experiences of uncertainty. In many instances, it seems that leaders are surrounded by those who will cause them pain and frustrate their good efforts. Today, the prevailing socio-economic and political tension have also been responsible for experiences of near-confusion being witnessed in some churches or parachurches. Thus, some leaders are struggling while some are contemplating `throwing in the towel.\\' Sadly some are already looking for succour elsewhere and will need persuasion and urgent reminder about the vision of where and how they started the race. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Will you act to fulfil God\\'s vision for your life, family and mankind? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> The Benefits of Having Vision <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nEvery Christian leader is expected to show commitment to the task of making positive impact on their immediate community. Because the focus of the Church is different from the world, the approaches and means of actualising the vision also differ. Human society, including the Church, celebrates only the achievers: no one pays much attention to the loser. In fact, there is a great difference between success and failure. Success usually attracts many friends but failure is an orphan. However, success does not come cheaply; it is mostly the result of hard work. Before a leader can experience breakthrough in the course of pursuing viable goals\/vision, much is involved. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p> \r\n        The world is full of distractions and Christian leaders are not totally immune to its influences. In some cases, to experience failure is not an \r\n        absence of true or genuine vision but the lack of understanding about how to overcome distractions. Some benefits of having vision are listed below: \r\n        \r\n        <\/p><ol>\r\n        <li>Vision helps in designing life\\'s goals and purpose. All men are created by God to fulfil specific goals in life. The greatest tragedy in life is not the failure to make wealth, but the failure to fulfill divine agenda.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>Vision prevents a pursuit of unprofitable goals in life. No man can achieve everything the heart craves, but to avoid wasteful labour, Christian leaders should pursue only worthwhile goals that emanates from vibrant vision received from God.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>Vision protects leaders from distraction and near-confusion. There are instances when only vibrant vision safeguards the efforts of both the leader and team members from losing focus.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>Vision creates and multiplies chances of success. \"If you do not stand for something, you will fall for everything\" is a popular adage. With the pursuit of a vision, one\\'s joy can be made full, but, without vibrant vision, success in any task or effort is only accidental.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>Every dream and idea is loaded toward attaining that vision. The vision gives you the reason to push through and to put your heart and soul behind what you are doing. Your reason can give you the strength to row that oar one more time when it seems all hope is lost.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>You are less likely to look back with regrets. Can you compare the number of times you have regretted doing something versus not doing anything? By stepping into the fullness of what we want we are allowing ourselves a fulfilling life, but to step back from what is in our hearts is only to set ourselves up for regret.  <\/li>\r\n        <li>Vision gives you hope.

Vision is a great tool that helps you to actively work on your passion and to create successful work around it. As God had vision for mankind, we must have vision for our life. . When, as Christ\\'s disciples you have a mental picture of what should g be, you are less likely to give up on your dream. By keeping the ideal picture in mind, you are able to keep yourself motivated even when the going gets tough. Having a heart-centered vision makes you come alive because it opens up possibility, creates hope and inspires meaning. Without a God-given vision, we will waste energy pursuing frivolous things and be at variance with God\\'s purpose for our lives individually and corporately. Unless we have vision for making disciples, we will fail to relate well with new believers and help them mature in the Lord. Being unrestrained, we may be unable to choose the best over the good.

In 1909, Miss Sonora Louis Smart Dodd was inspired by Miss Ann Javis\\'s effort to promote Mother\\'s Day in the United States of America. She reasoned that Father\\'s Day could also be commemorated to honour her father, Mr William Jackson Smart who single-handedly raised her and her six siblings after the death of their mother during childbirth. Her campaign caught the attention of the Spokane Ministerial Association and Young Men\\'s Christian Association (YMCA) in Spokane.

Their experiences may have given them a wrong view of an ideal father which affects how they look at themselves and others. The objective of Father\\'s Day is to remind every father of his uniqueness in God\\'s redemptive plan and the need to support church work. In the Bible, fatherhood is God\\'s idea (Genesis 1:28-29). It has worth. Fathers like Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Joseph and others played vital roles in fulfilling God\\'s redemptive plan for humankind.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b>The day encourages Churches and families to honour all fathers:<\/b> Father\\'s Day is a day set aside to honour all fathers, young and old who demonstrate Christian virtue such as care, hard work, foresight, diligence, succour and perseverance towards their families. The honour goes not only to those who have given birth to children but also to those who nurtured and reared children as if they were their own. Mothers, children and relatives are encouraged to send words of encouragement to such fathers in order to appreciate them and their worth. <\/li>\r\n<li><b>The day re-emphasises the need to rely on God in fulfilling the roles of fatherhood:<\/b> It is extremely difficult to be a father in this 21st century. Relying on God, however, makes it achievable. The programme activities for the day is attuned to correct, train, and equip fathers through the knowledge of God. The activities are meant to build the virtues of righteousness in the heart of fathers in order to help them make right choices in life. The day challenges the fathers to know God as the Source of life. The theme of the Father\\'s Day for each year serves as the basis for the pastor\\'s message. It gives fathers the opportunity to evaluate their lives and realign themselves into God\\'s plan.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b>The day promotes the ministry of Men's Missionary Union in recruiting and integrating fathers to church life:<\/b> There are some men in the church who are not involved actively in MMU because they do not see anything worthwhile to gain from it. A good presentation of the Father\\'s Day programme can serve as an eye-opener to challenge their mindset and become active members.  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        In what area has Father\\'s Day celebration added value to your life, fatherhood, and the church? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Our negative attitude to annual events in our churches becomes positive when we are well informed about how and why they began.

The idea of marking Children\\'s Day was adopted and proclaimed on November 20, 1954 by United Nations General Assembly and the very first Universal Children\\'s Day was celebrated all over the world in October 1955. After 1959, it started being celebrated on the 20th of November, as that day marked the anniversary when the declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted. Different countries celebrate Children\\'s Day on different days \"to promote mutual exchange and understanding among children\" and \"initiate action to benefit and promote the welfare of the world\\'s children.\" The day is a public holiday for children and - gathered at different places for special march by various schools and the best school is honoured. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Children's Day in the Nigerian Baptist Convention <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe Nigerian Baptist Convention started to observe Children\\'s Day through the Family Life Education Division, then known as Children\\'s Ministry Division of the Christian Education Department with Rev.

It also stresses the need for them to bring up the child so that his heart will be opened to God early. \r\n        <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Children are very important to God.

Since the 1960s, the Nigeria Baptist Convention has established the Youth Ministry as a unit to mobilise Baptist youths towards taking the gospel to all who have not heard it. Another objective is to inculcate Christian disciplines in the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical development of the youths. To achieve these objectives, an annual Youth Week celebration in local Baptists churches has become a strategy. The church pastor\/leader relinquishes his authority for a week to a youth pastor in June every year. NBC Youth Ministry designs a weeklong thematic programme from which other sub-themes in the area of marital, vocational, physical, intellectual, etc., are derived. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Why Youth Ministry?  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere is a need for effective youth ministry in our local Baptist churches today because of the following reasons: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li>  God commands it (Ecclesiastes 12:1; Proverbs 1:1-8; 3:1-2). Being a wise ruler, Solomon did not want the youth to be influenced by the evil culture of the society. His instructions contained the content of Christian education for today\\'s youth. Daniel lived in Babylon, a heathen society but his Jewish education in his tender age informed his decision that made him to stand out (Daniel 1:7). <\/li>\r\n<li>  The contemporary society demands it: Today\\'s youths are living in a world characterised by violence in form of kidnapping, ritual killing, savagery, rape and craving for materialism. The moral laxity has negative influence on the Baptist youth and the church needs to respond.  <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Why are some youths only committed to church during the Youth Week celebration?\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  What are the Significance of NBC Annual Youth Week celebration?  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are values, which the Baptist youth and the Church can derive from the annual Youth Week celebration: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li><b>  Bridging the generation gap between youths and adults: <\/b> Generation gap refers to age differences between adults and youth. This can be the cause of Church conflict because each of them look at the same issue from different standpoint. The annual Youth Week programme can provide an opportunity to bridge the gap through lively interaction between the adult member of the church and the youth. Doctrinal issues such as Baptist distinctives (autonomy of the local church, separation of the church and state) and the Baptist beliefs on Holy Spirit, prayer, speaking in tongues, and marriage, can be discussed in an atmosphere of love between the adult and the youth.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Understanding youth lfe:  <\/b>The world of youth is different from that of the adult. Youth Week celebration provides an eye-opener to the church leadership on the worldview, language, social, intellectual, spiritual, physical and emotional needs of the contemporary youth for the church to effectively minister to them. The weekly activities such as Bible study, marriage talk, career choice and question time provide a window into youth life in order to reach out to them according to their level of understanding.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Guiding youth to make right decisions: <\/b> Due to their inexperience, Youth Week celebration provides an avenue to give guidance to youth in acquiring entrepreneurship skills and choosing a life partner. When adults share their experiences, the youths are guided to make wise choices. The right interpretation of the Bible can also guide them in this area.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Discovering their leadership potential: <\/b> An annual Youth Week celebration in local churches allow one of the youthss to be the \"church pastor\" for a week. The church leader relinquishes his pastoral authority for a week to a youth pastor. He preaches on a Sunday service and coordinates the weekly activities. Some youths have been touched by the report of mission effort to the unreached. God uses this programme to prepare them for a future assignment. History has shown that today\\'s denominational leaders were once youth pastors. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Recruiting youths into church life:  <\/b> Some youths become active church members through the Youth Week celebration. Drama, variety night, sport activities, and visitation to Motherless Homes have attracted some of them to the Youth Week after which they turn out to be strong church members. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n       \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Youth week is not a mere celebration but a way to help youths discover their potentials. The church must encourage such event for empowerment of our youth for a better future. This will enhance healthy church growth and kingdom expansion.

No single individual has all that it takes for an organisation to function maximally. Hence, the different personalities that make up the organisation deserve due recognition and respect. To ignore this fact about human management is to give room for ill feeling, gossip and sometimes strike action. There was a time when petroleum tankers\\' drivers went on strike in Nigeria, and one of them said that even though he had no formal education, together with his colleagues, they had what it took to ground the nation.

In other words, trust and acceptance are when a leader has confidence in someone and entrusts responsibilities to him or her. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n         Share your personal experiences of how trust and acceptance helped you to serve well. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> The Value of Trust and Acceptance in Human Management  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nIn any human organisation, when there are trust and acceptance, there is a sense of belonging. It makes the subordinate to see himself or herself as part of the organisation. Also, trust and acceptance give room for people to make use of their potentials. A leader may not know what a follower is capable of doing until there is trust. When people are trusted and accepted, they are given room to prove themselves. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are the values of trust and acceptance in any establishment?\r\n\r\n\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Some Practical Approaches to Trust and Acceptance <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nEvery relationship begins at a point. For trust and acceptance to take place, there should be communication. A manager or leader who has a new staff member should take time to interact with him or her. Allow him or her to talk about himself or herself. Also, trust and acceptance demand that the leader should take the subordinate as he claims to be, until proven otherwise. Trust and acceptance should entail delegation of duties. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Discuss ways leaders should demonstrate trust and acceptance.

Leaders should allow trust to build up with time, rather than being too quick to entrust sensitive responsibility to erring follower. Also, there is the need to test claims by an individual so that the genuineness of such claims may be proven. These cautions have become inevitable due to the high level of betrayal of trust.   \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        In church work, what can members do to guard against betrayal of trust as not to damage the unity and love in the church? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 4 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        There are many families that have been torn apart due to lack of trust.

The system includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that are in operation in any country or globally. Thus, commerce is a system or an environment that affects the business prospects of economy. It can also be defined as a component of business which includes all activities and functions involved in transferring goods from producers to the buyers. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Some should tell the group what commerce is. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Commerce as a Distribution Channel <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nCommerce looks after the distribution aspect of a business. Whatever is produced must be consumed. To facilitate this consumption there must be a proper distribution channel. The channel is whereby the producer distributes to wholesale and retail outlets then finally to the consumers. This is why there is need for the knowledge of commerce to aid the smooth running of business. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What steps can we take as Christ's disciples to make goods and services accessible and affordable to the common man? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  Reasons for the Knowledge of Commerce  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol> \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b>Commerce tries to satisfy increasing human wants<\/b>\r\n            <p> Human wants are never ending. They can be classified as `basic wants\\' and `secondary wants.\\' Commerce has made distribution and movement of goods possible from one part of the world to the other. Today, we can buy anything produced anywhere in the world. This in turn enables man to satisfy his innumerable wants, thereby promoting social welfare.  <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b> Commerce helps to increase our standard of living <\/b>\r\n            <p> Standard of living refers to quality of life enjoyed by the members of a society. When man consumes quality products, his standard of living improves. To consume a variety of goods he must be able to secure them first. Commerce helps us to get what we want at the right time, right place and at the right price thus improving our standard of living. <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b> Commerce links producers and consumers <\/b>\r\n            <p> Production is meant for ultimate consumption. Commerce makes it possible to link producers and consumers through retailers and wholesalers and also through the aids to trade. Consumers get information about different goods through advertisements and salesmanship. The manufacturers are regularly informed about the likes and dislikes of the consumers through marketing research. Thus, commerce creates contact between the centres of production and consumption and links them. <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <b> Commerce generates employment opportunities <\/b>\r\n        <p> The growth of commerce, industry and trade bring about the growth of agencies of trade such as banking, transport, warehousing, advertising, etc. These agencies need people to look after their functioning. Increase in production results in increasing demand, which further results in boosting employment opportunities. Thus development of commerce generates more employment opportunities for millions of people in a country. <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <b> Commerce increases national income and wealth <\/b>\r\n        <p> When production increases, national income also increases. In a developed country, manufacturing industries and commerce together accounts for nearly 80 per cent of total national income. It also helps to earn foreign exchange by way of exports and duties levied on imports. Thus, commerce increases the national income and wealth of a nation.  <\/p>\r\n        <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Do we have reasons to hoard goods to sell it at higher price and make life unbearable to the masses?\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  Selling Skills  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n Emphasis in this lesson is that skill acquisition without marketing skill is useless and this calls for the knowledge of commerce.

As Christians, we are encouraged to create time to learn about it for a better living.         \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What attempt will you make to practise ICT at your business organisation? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> Encourage someone in your neighbourhood to learn ICT.  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":29,"title":"learning about crafts","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> JULY WEEK 4 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> LEARNING ABOUT CRAFTS  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH  51 (1991 Ed)  <\/b> Creator God, Creating Still <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>    Exodus 31:3  <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, disciples  should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Give the meaning of crafts.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Explain the processes of craft making.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <li> Itemise the gains to align with the concept of skill acquisition.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Discussion\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\nSomeone in the class should explain his\/her understanding of the creative nature of God.

In this study, your knowledge of how other things and processes work will improve. Through learning and developing a craft, one gains a fuller understanding of something very specific. Since this month\\'s topics enable us to understand skill acquisition, it is therefore a necessity to know that skill can be endowed and that is called craft that is inbuilt skill. What is craft? What can we do with it? Let us check the answers together.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> What is Craft?  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nCraft is more of an inbuilt skill, style or application, than a tangible object.\r\n<b> Craft is your technique; your brain\\'s neural connections, sculpted over hours of practice. <\/b>\r\nFor instance, your craft is the way you apply paint to a canvas, how you think about a new musical composition or how you structure your written sentences in a short story or how you make your meal to give it a unique taste. Theoretically, one\\'s craft can be applied to various mediums, such as writing and film directing. Often, there is not enough time in the day to apply it to more than one focus, but it is certainly possible. It is through working on that which you love that it can be matured over time. The fact is, everyone possesses craft. It is simply down to you to develop and nurture it over time. Understanding where your craft lies can make or define you. It can be a very powerful motivator to keep you going. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Someone should explain craft in his\/her own words. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> What to Do with Craft  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n            <ol>\r\n            <li>\r\n            <b> Discover it <\/b> \r\n            <p>  A lot of people do not know the potentials they have, so the first thing is to discover it.

This is so hard to do because people often focus on making crafts that they themselves like, without considering either (a) the competition for the product or (b) how many others share that interest. Sometimes a person becomes so enamoured of his or her own particular craft product that they either will not do the necessary market research to determine if their product is saleable, or they ignore what their market research tells them. Remember this: in order to make a living from your crafts, you must provide what customers want, not merely what you like making. An honest appraisal of product\\'s marketability is important. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> What are your thoughts? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> Now, go and work on your craft, and stop making up excuses! <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":30,"title":"learning about fish farming ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> JULY WEEK 5 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> LEARNING ABOUT FISH FARMING  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 50 (1991ed) <\/b> God, Who Made the Earth   <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>  Ecclesiastes 10:10   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, disciples  should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>Define fish farming.   <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li>Mention and explain different types of fish farming.   <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <li>List the requirements for fish farming, visit a fish pond and observe how it is being done.   <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Brainstorming\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         \r\n            <p> v Are there families that do not eat fish? <\/p> \r\n\r\n            <p> v Can we calculate together how many fish are eaten every week by individual families?<\/p> \r\n\r\n            <p> v Imagine if the fish were bought from your pond?

It is also widely referred to as off-shore cultivation. Fish are kept in the cage-like structures and where they are artificially fed and harvested. The cage method has made numerous technological advances over the years, especially in reducing diseases and environmental concerns. However, the number one concern of the cage method is fish escaping and being lost among the wild fish population. \r\n<\/p>   \r\n         <\/li>\r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n            <li> \r\n                <b> Irrigation ditch or pond systems <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nThe second method is irrigation ditch or pond systems of raising fish. The basic requirement for this method is to have a ditch or a pond that holds water. This is a unique system because at a small level, fish are artificially fed and the waste produced by the fish is then used to fertilise farmers\\' fields. On a larger scale, mostly in ponds, the pond is self-sustaining as it grows plants and algae for fish food. \r\n<\/p>   \r\n         <\/li>\r\n\r\n            <li> \r\n                <b>Composite fish culture<\/b>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe third method of fish farming is called composite fish culture which is a type of fish farming that allows both local fish species and imported fish species to coexist in the same pond.

Skill acquisition is no doubt what dying economies all over the world need for revival. Therefore it should be taught, understood and practised. One of the advantages is the creation of job. Unemployment is the epidemic we need to curb and totally eradicate. Skill acquisition is treated from different angles: fish farming, ICT knowledge, craft knowledge and commerce.

In his reaction to this, a Reformed Church pastor in Amsterdam, the Netherlands made the following comments: \"Conversion to Christianity is not promoted in our church, so we see very little of it\"; and, \"Everyone is a child of God.\" How would you describe this pastor\\'s brand of Christianity? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Characteristics of Postmodernism <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe following are some of the major characteristics of postmodernism: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li><b> Relativity of Truth and Denial of the Transcendent: <\/b>Relativity of truth is the idea that there is no absolute truth or standard of morality and as such any claim of such is wrong. This is a sort of \"anything goes\" mentality. Postmodernism also believes that knowledge is dependent on one\\'s perspective. There are various aspects of this feature of postmodernism. First, there are those who believe that reality is a social construction, that is, what we know as absolute reality, that is, God, is a mere human creation. Second, there are those who believe that if there was ever a God, that he is dead. Nietzsche (1844-1900) argued that \"God is dead.\" Third, there are those who argue that there is no single unifying story or grand narrative that gives meaning and cohesion to life. And fourth, there are those who believe that though there is God, there is no single legitimate way of knowing him. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Cultural Determinism:<\/b> Postmodernism strongly believes that what individuals become is shaped by their culture which itself is created by language; hence, we are trapped in a \"prison of language.\" Those who are aware of the nature-nurture debate in philosophy and psychology would appreciate this better. To postmodernists, nurture, especially one\\'s culture, shapes his\/her development, and the vehicle of that shaping is language.  <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Rejection of Individual Identity: <\/b>This is another characteristic of postmodernism. It claims that people exist as members of a group, not as individuals. In fact, in postmodernist thought, the individual has no place; it is the group that matters. It believes that groups should empower and assert themselves. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Rejection of Humanism:<\/b> Unlike in modernism where such concepts as human creativity, individual autonomy, and human priority over other creatures are accepted as norms and values, postmodernism stridently rejects them, claiming that they are the bedrock of human exclusion and oppression of other creatures. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Power Reductionism:<\/b> To postmodernists, all institutions, human relationships, and moral values are masks for power. According to them, all that modernists want is to control others. Likewise postmodernism rejects reason, because reason is simply an illusory mask for cultural power. Logic is simply a means of control.<\/li>\r\n<li><b> Revolutionary Critique of the Existing Order:<\/b> In postmodernist\\'s thought, the modern society needs to be replaced. It believes that modernism is too attached to scientific knowledge. Science, at least hard science, is too tied to the premise of absolute truth. Segmentation of society into various groups is the only action that will allow true cultural pluralism. There is a connection to Marxism in this characteristic. Marx\\'s theory was that human society must change and that the result of any revolution would, by definition, produce a better society. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Incessant Choice:<\/b> A key feature of postmodernism is the prevalence of unending alternatives to choose from. Be it in automobile, fashion, electronics, cosmetics, travel, communication, etc., the range of choices before the individual is overwhelming. From supermarkets to departmental stores and shopping malls, the consumer is presented with a wide-range of options between and within brands through aggressive marketing techniques by companies. A direct consequence of this is consumerism and hyper-materialism. <\/li>\r\n<li><b> Globalisation:<\/b> According to the Financial Times of London, globalisation refers to \"the integration of economies, industries, markets, cultures and policy-making around the world. (It) describes a process by which national and regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through the global network of trade, communication, immigration and transportation.\" A simple way of describing globalisation is that the world is like a global village wherein what happens in one part spreads to other parts, sometime like wildfire. Two recent examples are the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and the Zika virus. Globalisation is a major feature of the postmodern era. <\/li>\r\n<li><b>  ICT Impact on Social Life:<\/b> Historians of science and technology acknowledge two major global revolutions that have impacted human existence. They are the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries and the Information Revolution in the 20th and 21st centuries. The former lasted from 1760 to about 1840. The Information Revolution is now in vogue with Information and Communication Technology in its various forms trending. The use of computers and other digital instruments have come to stay. These are impacting social life in ways that were not imagined possible in the past. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How has globalisation affected your local area?\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Evaluation of Postmodernism <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nGoing through the above characteristics, we can deduce that postmodernism is a mixed baggage. It has the good, the bad, and the ugly. On the positive side, it has helped to show the lie in modernism\\'s triumphalism and human-centredness. Modernism had this utopian notion of its superiority over preceding human epochs and other forms of thought. It believed that reason and the scientific method will usher humanity into socio-political, economic and technological paradise. It introduced a heightened sense of individualism and rejection of the non-corporeal and transcendent. The production and use of the atomic bomb in war and the negative impacts of other scientific and technological inventions helped to demonstrate that not everything about modernism or its claims were beneficial. To that extent, postmodernism is commendable. However, postmodernism poses some dangers of its own. Its emphasis on the group over and above the individual has the potential to stifle initiative and curtail individual rights. The other criticisms of postmodernism include its rejection of belief in grand narrative of life and of reason, as well as its encouragement of consumerism and materialism. From a religious and ethical point of view, the greatest disservice of postmodernism is its belief that the idea of God is man-made, that truth is relative, and that there is no absolute standard of morality. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        From the above description of modernism and postmodernism, which of them do you think is more dangerous to the Christian faith? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Human historical epochs do not change the Word of God.

We should align ourselves at all times with the word and will of God. One of the most dangerous teachings of postmodernism is the notion that morality is relative. This is contrary to the revealed will of God. So the disciple of Christ should be aware and always evaluate all human ideas with the Word of God. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>  How true the argument is that one\\'s culture alone shapes his\/her development, exclusive of other factors?   <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> What are the implications of postmodernism to Christian living? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":32,"title":"postmodernism and ministry to children","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> AUGUST WEEK 2 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> POSTMODERNISM AND MINISTRY TO CHILDREN  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 511 <\/b>  Praise Him, All Ye Little Children  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>   Luke 15:12-32 <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, disciples  should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Use the parable of the prodigal son to draw out the postmodernist mindset as it pertains to children. <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Identify ways to minister to them within the context of postmodernism. <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Opinion Sharing\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            Children love cartoon shows and TV programmes.

They can be great instruments in the hand of the Lord for good or veritable weapons of destruction in the hand of the devil. God in Christ has a scheme to redeem children and reclaim them from the grip of sin but Satan has a strategy to keep them in bondage and under the control of the forces of darkness. The devil has always designed and\/or utilised various irreligious and anti-God schemes, strategies and ideas in all historical epochs to destabilise God\\'s programme, plan and purpose for mankind. Whereas not everything in each epoch is bad, yet he somehow finds a way to control and dominate them. This is true with postmodernism. An area that this is applicable is children. The character of the prodigal son in the parable named after him illustrates for us the life of a child controlled by a postmodern mindset. What is this mindset? It is a mindset of godlessness, licentiousness and avarice. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Five Basic Senses Every Child Needs <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nEvery child needs five basic senses if they are to function well and fully realise their potentials. The prodigal son manifests these senses in Luke 15:12-13. They include the following: \r\n\r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li>A sense of intimacy: Where do I fit in? This is a question of relationships.<\/li><li>\r\n\r\n<\/li><li>A sense of identity: Who am I? This is the most crucial.<\/li><li>\r\n\r\n<\/li><li> A sense of initiative: What can I do? This is a question of purpose.<\/li><li>\r\n\r\n<\/li><li>A sense of innovation: What new thing can I do or where can I go? This is a question of adventure.<\/li><li>\r\n\r\n<\/li><li>A sense of choice: What should I do? This is a question of preferred alternative.<\/li><li> \r\n<\/li><\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What can the Church do to be more proactive in Children Ministry to minister to children effectively? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> The Prodigal Son and the Five Senses <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> When the prodigal son called his dad, `Father,\\' he was expressing a sense of intimacy based on a father-son relationship. Every child needs a father in order to enjoy the full benefits of what it means to come from a home. Obviously there was an on-going relationship between him and his father, even though we do not know how cordial it was. Mind you, to be a father is not just a biological function through procreation. It is all embracing: procreation, provision, and protection. But the prodigal son abused the privilege of intimacy. This is the problem of abuse of inherent opportunity. <\/li>\r\n        <li> When he told his father to give him the portion of his property that was due him, he was expressing his sense of identity: he knew his father and that his father was rich. Thus he surmised that a kid whose father was rich was also rich. But instead of waiting for the appropriate time to receive what belonged to him, he wanted it `quick-quick\\' (speedily). By asking for his own share of his father's property he was doing the unthinkable. No one inherits his father\\'s property while he is still alive! Thus it was as if he was saying to his father, \"Father, why are you still alive? Since you have refused to die, give me my inheritance!\" This is the problem of greed and impatience. <\/li>\r\n        <li> When he gathered together what his father gave him, he manifested the sense of initiative. He was answering the question, what can I do? He had initiative, which is a good quality everybody needs in life. You would notice that he did not gather the things immediately his father gave them to him but took some days before doing so. That tells us that he was not an ignoramus. He apparently knew what he was doing. This is the problem of misguided initiative. <\/li>\r\n        <li> When the Prodigal Son took his goods and went into \"a far country,\" he was responding to the adventure drive within him. He wanted to explore his world, to try something new, to test the \"greener\" grass out there. Within every child is a latent pull to `a far country.\\' Adventure and exploration are handmaids of discovery. What you dream you become; yet it must be at the right time and with the appropriate preparation. But this boy wanted to run before walking. This is the problem of premature independence.<\/li>\r\n        <li>  Life is full of choices and every choice has its corresponding consequences. So when the prodigal son \"wasted his substance with riotous living,\" he was expressing his sense of choice. The qualifier, `riotous\\' means that there was an alternative form of living. For instance, he could have chosen `righteous living\\' rather than the riotous one. The Word of God cannot be broken, \"There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death\" (Proverbs 14:12). We can imagine some of the things that constituted the riotous life he indulged in: partying, fornication, drunkenness, avarice, gluttony, and all manner of latest music. This is the problem of self-indulgence.<\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How could children ministers train children to make positive use of their five senses within the context of a postmodern world? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Ministry to Children within the Context of Postmodernism <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nHow should the church minister to children within the context of a postmodern world? \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li> The Church should be aware of the reality of postmodernism and its characteristics. <\/li>\r\n<li>  The Church should equip and train her children workers with the relevant skills and competencies required to minister to children in a postmodern world.  <\/li>\r\n<li>  The Church should educate parents on healthy parenting in a postmodern world. <\/li>\r\n<li>  We identified the following respective problems children of all epochs face but especially in our postmodern context: the problem of inherent opportunity, the problem of greed and impatience, the problem of misguided initiative, the problem of premature independence, and the problem of self-indulgence.

The prodigal son channeled his own wrongly because of the fact that the centrepiece of his sense of identity was selfishness. The prodigal son had no regard or place for God in his scheme of things until he reached the bottom of the futility of his wastefulness after \"he came to his senses\" when he realised that he had sinned against \"heaven\" (vv. 17-18). Every child needs to develop their senses of intimacy, identity, initiative, innovation, and choice. However, the spirit of postmodernism can corrupt these senses and thereby lead them astray. The greatest theological danger it poses is its argument against the existence of God which then carries with it the greatest ethical danger, namely, the idea that truth and morality are relative. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How can parents proactively protect their children from the negative aspects of postmodernism? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> God gave everyone the freedom to make choices.

Some of the dynamics are nothing but love of the world and its contents. What are the contents of the world? They are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, all of which are transient (1 John 2:15-17). Love of the world is synonymous with friendship with it, which is tantamount to enmity with God (James 4:4). A section of the human society that is most susceptible to the influence of postmodernism is the youth. Consider the following characteristics of the contemporary youth: inquisitiveness, frequent change of church affiliation, high mobility, celebrity consciousness, fashion craze, entertainment and sport addiction, rejection of tradition, resistance to authority, addiction to the social media, and high ICT literacy. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> The Last Days <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nOne of the passages of Scripture that best encapsulates what the postmodern spirit looks like among youths is 2 Timothy 3:1-7. Apostle Paul outlines the characteristics of what he calls \"perilous times\" of the `last days\\'. Youths are more prone to them. That is why we want to use the passage to talk about postmodernism and ministry to the youth. In order to enhance our understanding of today\\'s study, we have divided the discussion into three parts, namely, perilous men, pernicious (or destructive) techniques, and permanent termination. The line of reasoning goes this way: perilous men will use pernicious techniques to achieve their destructive aims but will eventually face permanent defeat. But let\\'s first describe the meaning of two key words, `perilous\\' and `last days\\'. The word `perilous\\' means extremely dangerous, hard, fierce, terrible (cf. Matthew 8:28); while `last days\\' refers to the period of time between the first coming of Christ and His return. The characteristics of the last days outlined in the passage are reminiscent of the days of Noah prior to the Flood (see Genesis 6:5-7). \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Perilous Men (vv. 1-5) <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nPerilous times are very dangerous as a result of the activities of perilous men. Perilous men are known by the following: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n <li>The condition of their hearts: what they love self, money and pleasure.<\/li>\r\n <li> The words of their mouths: how and what they speak pride, arrogance, boasting and lies.<\/li> \r\n <li>The attitude of their lives: what they think blasphemy, treachery, rebellion and hypocrisy.<\/li>\r\n <li>The acts of their hands: what they do brutality and heartlessness.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li> The nature of their faith: apostasy and empty religion with form but no content, or ritual without righteousness.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The source of their doctrines: demons (1Timothy 4:1).<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The content of their teaching: heresies (1Timothy 4:2-3).<\/li> \r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p> We can simply describe the lifestyle, thoughts, attitudes, actions, and religion of perilous men as purely evil. It is like a virus of universal proportion engineered by the man of perdition. Evil men will even get worse as we get closer to the end time. The ultimate objective of perilous men is the destruction of anything godly, be it the people of God, the purpose of God, and\/or the plan of God. <\/p>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n       \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Pernicious Techniques (vv. 6-7) <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nIn order to execute their wicked objectives as outlined above, perilous men mostly employ techniques that are opposite to their wicked characteristics. Thus their techniques or methods of operation are subtle, insidious, sinister, and serious. The techniques include craftiness, control, and insatiable but empty quest for knowledge. Why do they employ such techniques?

It would seem as if the picture of the last days painted to Timothy by Apostle Paul was intended to instill fear and trepidation in him, but that is far from the truth; the opposite is rather the case. Thus he tells Timothy, \"they will progress no further!\" No matter how strong, well organised and\/or formidable evil might be, there is a terminal date for its existence and operations. In order to drive home the point, Paul mentions two examples of evil men and the folly and futility of their wicked ways. They are Jannes and Jambres. \r\nThe Bible does not mention the names of these two men but Jewish tradition has it that they were part of the Egyptian magicians that attempted to countermand God\\'s miraculous intervention for the deliverance of His people from Egypt (cf. Exodus 7:11; 9:11). Paul describes these men in four ways: \r\n<\/p><ol type=\"a\">\r\n <li>They resist the truth.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>They are disapproved regarding the faith.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Their minds are corrupt.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Their folly will be exposed in due course.<\/li> \r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p> These same attributes are akin to some of the characteristics of postmodernism such as the rejection of belief in the existence of God and of the idea of absolute truth.

So the Church is under obligation to minister to adults.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5>  Pressures Posed by Postmodernism to Adults <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nPostmodernism poses some challenges by way of pressures to adults. While some of them cut across different epochs but with certain peculiarity, others are totally unique to the postmodernist mindset. The following are eight of such pressures: \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n<li> <b> The pressure of catching up with the dynamics of the period:<\/b> We highlighted key dynamics of postmodernism in Week 1 of this study. Let\\'s remind ourselves of the dynamics: relativity of truth and moral standard, cultural determinism, rejection of individual identity, rejection of humanism, power reductionism, revolutionary critique of the existing order, incessant choice, globalisation, the use of ICT and addiction to social life. Adults face the challenge of catching up with these.  <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>  The pressure of the use of ICT:<\/b> The average youth of today is ICT literate. They know how to operate the computer and the jargon associated with them. They know about CPU, monitor, mouse, URL, website, tablet, email, internet banking, gigabyte, RAM, android, memory, etc. Most adults of a certain age do not know what some of these terms mean, especially within the context of ICT where the words have unique meanings. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>  The pressure of understanding the social media:<\/b> A major area globalisation is evident is communication through the virtual world. There are so many available social media platforms which youths utilise on a 24\/7 basis. You have Facebook, WhatsApp, MySpace, Instagram, Twitter, ChatON, Messenger, etc. Youths are constantly connected to them as they communicate with one another. The social media has changed and\/or expanded the meaning of certain traditional words. For example, Facebook has redefined friendship such that one may have friends that he\/she may not have met personally before but except through the media platform. Of course, this has brought in its wake certain challenges. Most adults of a certain age do not and may not be able to comprehend the social media, let alone use them. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b>  The pressure of managing the insatiable demands from their children:<\/b> Children will always be children. One of the dynamics of our present time is incessant choices by the children. Yesteryears, the choice for a child would have been between wearing bathroom slippers and walking barefooted. Today, the choice is between one designer shoe or another; in times past it was between choosing eba and fufu or amala, today it is between fried rice\/Indomie noodles; it used to be a choice between entering danfo\/molue bus and a taxi cab to school, today it is between daddy\\'s SUV and mummy\\'s air-conditioned car. Adults struggle with such demands. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b> The pressure of passing on cherished traditions to their children:<\/b> Every society or culture has its cherished traditions. Due to its nature, the postmodern spirit challenges such traditions that were passed on across generations as it questions and\/or suspects their foundation. Most adults struggle with explaining to young people the reasons they should adopt and abide by certain traditions whether in the community or the church. In times past, for example, most children would remain in the church of their parents as it is seen as a family heritage, but today parents may be in one church while their children may be in three different churches. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b> The pressure of collapse of moral values:<\/b> This is a corollary to the preceding point. If loyalty to age-long traditions is on the decline, commitment to traditional moral values would naturally follow suit. This in fact is one of the most tragic narratives of the present era. From our African perspective, some of the cherished traditions that have been bastardised are communal solidarity, respect for elders and constituted authority, chastity before marriage, marital fidelity in heterogeneous marital unions, hard work, merit, belief in the sanctity of life, and honesty. Today to abide by these values sometimes looks odd in certain settings. Thus the opposite of these values is what obtains. Consequently some adults are bewildered and sometimes in shock by this turn of events.<\/li>\r\n<li> <b> The pressure of unstable job\/source of income and of providing for their families:<\/b> One of the major pressures faced by adults is that of unemployment, under-employment, loss of jobs, low or irregular income and the concomitant challenge these pose to them regarding providing for their families. The factors responsible for this bleak employment and income situation among the adult working class range from the global economic outlook to mismanagement of resources and corruption within nation states. Also, some of the factors are political while others are socio-economic. Thus, adults are faced with a double-edged sword namely, low or dwindling income in the face of skyrocketing inflation. They struggle with the load of providing decent accommodation for their families, paying school fees, providing food and clothing, and taking care of family health and medical needs. <\/li>\r\n<li> <b> The pressure of social fragmentation:<\/b> In the past, the average human society was stable and predictable in the normal ebbs and flows of life. It is no longer so. There is so much social fragmentation along ethnic, social, religious, political, professional, and communal lines that leaves people of goodwill bewildered. There is a `we\\' versus `they\\' mentality whereby those outside of one\\'s circle of `we' are considered to be enemies that should be conquered, if not destroyed. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>  Ministry to Adults in an Age of Postmodernism <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe above challenges faced by adults in our time call for outside-of-the-box thinking if they are to be effectively ministered to. What should the Church do in the light of this? \r\n<\/p><ol>\r\n\r\n<li>  Train and equip adults with the relevant knowledge and skills that would enable them withstand the challenges of the times. <\/li>\r\n<li> Encourage them to embrace ICT literacy, as much as possible. The Church may organise computer literacy programmes for the willing adults.  <\/li>\r\n<li> The Church should train and teach adults to be role models and mentors to the youths. This is the essence of Paul\\'s injunction in Titus 2:1-5 regarding ministry to adult members of his church. Older men are to be role models in temperance, respect, self-control, faith, love and endurance to younger men; while the older women by personal example and precepts are to guide the younger women to be good wives and mothers.  <\/li>\r\n<li> Adults need to be encouraged to exercise hope in the Lord despite the way things are at the present time. <\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Postmodernism poses peculiar challenges to adults. Fortunately, such challenges are surmountable. With proper information and re-education, adults can understand some of the dynamics of our times as they pertain to computers and the digital world. With the way the world is going, and not very far from now, the condition of an adult that is not computer literate will be like that of an adult of today that cannot read and write. So, just as churches have adult literacy programmes, they should develop adult computer literacy programmes for their members. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Closing Remarks message here -->\r\n        \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li>  Let us highlight with examples some of the dangers associated with the use of the social media.  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li>  How can parents monitor what their children are doing on their computer and on social media? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <li> How many members of the group have active email addresses? <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <li>  Let someone with basic ICT literacy explain to members how to open and use an email address. <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n        \r\n        <h4> ROADMAP FOR DISCIPLES<\/h4>\r\n        <p>There are four lessons in this unit. It is possible that before this unit\\'s lesson you might not have heard about postmodernism or if you had, you might not have been able to describe what it means and how the Church can minister to the various age groups in the church within its context. But now you have known, it is incumbent on each disciple to apply the lessons learnt to their situations. Individuals, families, groups and the Church should be willing to re-evaluate their ministry strategies in the light of contemporary challenges without diluting the Gospel message. As a disciple of Christ, can you explain the meaning of postmodernism in simple terms? How much are you aware of postmodernist influences around you and in your own life? A major feature of our times is the prevalence of ICT usage. As a child of God how can you be computer-literate without being computer controlled? How can you utilise computer literacy for the promotion of the gospel? <\/p><\/p>"},{"id":35,"title":"an agent of smooth relationship ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> SEPTEMBER WEEK 1 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> AN AGENT OF SMOOTH RELATIONSHIP <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 465  <\/b>  God of Grace and God of Glory  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b>   Ephesians 4:25-32   <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, disciples  should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Explain what smooth relationship with others means. <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li> Demonstrate how to build smooth relationship as agents of transformation.  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Group Discussion\r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            In a world where individualism is threatening the unity of the Church, how can we build good relationship?\r\n         <\/p> <!-- MESSAGE  1 -->\r\n                    \r\n        <h4>Facilitator's Opening Remarks<\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        Good and cordial relationship is more than something we do hypocritically.

This smooth relationship allows members of the group to \r\nfeel supported and connected but still feel independent. Relationship is \r\na necessary part of healthy living, but there is no such thing as a \r\nperfect relationship. &nbsp;Relationship could be smooth when everyone \r\ninvolved is ready to give and take and expresses their feelings without \r\nany inhibition.   One who would want a smooth relationship should be\r\nready to respond to group members\\' feeling positively. \r\nSmooth relationship gives us several other benefits: our life is more \r\nenjoyable, people are more likely to go along with changes we may want \r\nto implement, and we are more innovative and creative. \r\nFurthermore, it brings us a great deal of happiness, fulfillment, strong \r\nconnections with loved ones; friends, church members, and colleagues. \r\nSmooth relationship equally allows us to be at our best physically, \r\nspiritually, socially and psychologically. It may also help members to \r\nobtain good advice, guidance, love and support.&nbsp;\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How can we recognise the difference between self-centered and genuine relationship? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Why Do We Need Good Relationships? <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nHuman beings are naturally very sociable. We enjoy the company of others and crave positive interactions and meaningful friendships. To some extent good relationships are just as important for our survival as air, water, and food; this can explain why our health and happiness suffers when our relationships go wrong. Therefore, the better our relationships work, the happier and healthier we are going to be. It has been observed that people with satisfying relationships are likely to have fewer health problems and live longer. In contrast, those who do not have many social connections tend to show signs of depression and cognitive decline. Good relationship is necessary because it supports the health and well-being of people.  \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>In the family life, having good relationship with spouse and children enhances peace and is helpful for progress and development. Good relationship between husband\/father and wife\/mother sets example for their children to emulate.  <\/p>\r\n        <p>In the church life, having good relationship with members and pastoral leadership fosters healthy growth and makes way for kingdom expansion. Likewise, in the workplace, having a good relationship with colleagues and others in the professional circle boosts productivity and is valuable for career development. Being on good terms with your boss means you are more likely to be considered if a new position opens up. There is also a sense of freedom. Rather than spending our time and energy overcoming obstacles associated with relationship issues, we are focused on opportunities and personal development.  <\/p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Do smooth relationship make life better within multi-ethnic society? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Foxes that Destroy Good Relationships <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are different foxes that render relationships ineffective and problematic and if they are not addressed as early as possible, it can lead to emotional and mental problems. Therefore, some of these foxes are discussed as follows: \r\n<\/p><p><b>1.     Criticism<\/b>: is the act of expressing disapproval and of noting \r\nthe problems or faults of a person. A remark or comment that \r\nexpresses approval\/disapproval of someone or something can both be \r\npositive or negative. It may be good criticism if it is done in a friendly manner \r\nto build up rather than in opposition to pull down which can damage \r\na smooth relationship.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2.     Gossip:<\/b> is one of the major relationship killers. Gossiping about \r\na situation will only stirs up animosity and cause mistrust and \r\nsuspicion between the parties involved. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.     Jealousy<\/b>: A lot of relationships have been destroyed due to \r\njealousy. Jealousy can make people try to destroy another\\'s reputation \r\nwhile they remain the saint. Jealousy, if not properly addressed, can lead \r\nto many other sins. Jealousy is a thing of the mind and when it starts, \r\nit leads to hatred and hatred leads to so many other sins against humanity.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.     Contempt: It <\/b>is talking down on somebody, \r\ninsulting&nbsp;or acting&nbsp;superior. Not only does this lead to relationship breakup, \r\nbut can cause illnesses for the recipient of the contempt.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>5.     Defensiveness<\/b>: Defensiveness starts when one easily feels \r\nattacked, blamed, controlled, manipulated, victimised and unfairly dealt with;usually when a loved one brings up a problem, dissatisfaction \r\nor difficulty.&nbsp; Defensiveness, a natural reaction to being criticised \r\ncan be in two forms namely; counterattacking or acting like an \r\ninnocent victim and whining. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>6.

Relationship needs proper care and attention of those who are involved. There is need for adjustment, good understanding and compromise. If we can follow certain steps, then it can be easier and comfortable to have strong relationships among relations, with spouse, family members, friends, neighbours, classmates, co-workers and so on. \r\n<\/p><p><b>1.     Communication<\/b> is at the heart of all relationships. All \r\nrelationship needs good communication. Your relationships will be richer if \r\nyou make an effort to keep in contact with those around you. \r\nBeing honest and open with others allows you to connect deeply and \r\nbuild long lasting bonds. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.     Love<\/b> nourishes your relationship softly and carefully like a \r\nmother takes care of her child. We must not allow ego, hatred and \r\nevil thought to come into our relationships. Nurturing our relationship \r\nis one of the most powerful secrets of smooth relationship. Be real \r\nand unique and let your partner also be like that. The freshness \r\nof relationship makes relations rejoice and get better.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.     Trust<\/b> is very important in any relationship and once it breaks \r\nthen no one can bring it back. Lack of trust will create problems \r\nin relationship and sometimes may cause break up. Truthfulness \r\nmakes relationship smooth and great. Relationships are built on trust, \r\nwhich is essential for good communication and forming strong \r\nbonds. Without trust, relationships are unlikely to survive.&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.     Sincerity<\/b> is the hallmark of a smooth relationship and it \r\ndetermines if it will go far and grow.

While salt preserves\r\n\r\nand sweetens, it has no value when it has lost its usefulness. In other words, salt makes its impact felt in food we eat and when it\\'s no longer useful or loses its importance then it is thrown away. No wonder Jesus Christ told His disciples that they are the salt and light of the world. Disciples of Christ are to make a difference as salt makes a difference in cooking. The primary purpose of any disciple is to impact his world to the honour of the Master who has called him\/her to follow Him. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Salt: a Metaphor <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nJesus Christ used salt as a metaphor to compare believers for a reason. Salt is a dietary mineral, used for flavouring and preservation. It is needed by all known living creatures. If abused, it can be harmful. However, it is also bad not to eat salt because it regulates the water content in our bodies. Jesus used salt to describe how Christians are needed to bring balance and hope to an otherwise dying world. It is interesting that when the early Christians were persecuted in the Roman Empire, the Christian apologists pleaded for tolerance saying that the society continued to exist because of Christians. In essence they were saying that Christians upheld the good values in life; they worked for reconciliation and peace and they prayed for the empire and its well being. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Of what benefit is the salt if it loses its flavour or value?

Salt is palatable.<\/b> It adds taste to the food we eat. Salt brings \r\nout flavour.

Salt is precious. \r\n<\/b>In Jesus\\' day, salt was a rare commodity and thus \r\nhad enormous value. Greek aristocrats had a custom of exchanging their \r\nslaves with salt. If the slave did not meet the purchaser\\'s expectation, that \r\nslave \"was not worth his salt,\" hence the expression, \"He is not worth his \r\nsalt.\" As salt, followers of Jesus are extremely precious \"commodities\" in \r\nthis world.

Though you may not see it with your naked eye, it does \r\nits work silently and effectively. Followers of Jesus worth their salt \r\nwill not want to toot their own horn or make a lot of noise, but they \r\nwill quietly and effectively diffuse the flavour of the gospel to \r\nmany communities around them.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.     Salt preserves and thus prevents decay. \r\n<\/b>&nbsp;There were no freezers in Jesus\\' day as we have today. The only way to preserve \r\nfood, such as meat, was to salt it away and thus prevent it from decay. What Jesus is saying to His followers, is that we are that \"palatable, precious, penetrating preservative that prevents decay.\" And we are that \"salt of the earth\" to protect people from the stress of living and toiling, working at their economies, building their communities, and developing cultures. \r\n<\/p>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What do you do when salt and sand are mixed together?

By Functioning Like Seasoning \r\nAgent: Salt spices things up<em>. It improves the taste of the food it comes in contact \r\nwith.<\/em> Christian values should improve the nature of the society and make it \r\nbetter. Food without salt is tasteless. A disciple of Christ\\'s is one who \r\nby his anointing brings a new flavour of love, joy, peace, \r\nforbearance, courage, hope, care, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, kindness \r\nand self-control into the life of others. If seasoning has no flavour, it has \r\nno value. When a thing loses its essential quality and fails to perform \r\nits essential duty, it is good for nothing but to be thrown away.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.      Purifying Agent: Salt is used for purification. \r\n<\/b>The same way salt has healing power, Christians should counteract moral decay (2 \r\nKings 20:21).&nbsp; The purifying property of salt was referred to in its \r\nsymbolic use by Elisha in his miracle of the healing the waters of Jericho. \r\nThe symbolism of salt, therefore, in the words of our Lord Jesus, is \r\nclearly that the influence of a true Christian upon the world is healing, \r\npurifying influence, always tending to the preservation of that which is \r\ngood from the adverse elements of putrefaction and \r\ndecay.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>3.      Preservative Agent: Salt gives food an improved length \r\nof life. <\/b>The preservative qualities of salt make it, when so used, a \r\nfitting symbol of an enduring compact. Salt is the earliest of all \r\npreservatives. The&nbsp;Greeks used to say that salt could put \"a new soul into \r\ndead things.\"&nbsp;Without salt some things will decay and go bad.  \r\nSalt preserves food from decay. As the salt of the earth, we are called to  \t\r\n\r\npreserve the faith which we have received and to pass it on intact to others. Our generation is being challenged in a special way to keep safe the deposit of faith (2 Thessalonians 2:15, 1 Timothy 6:20, 2 Timothy 1:14). We must act as a preservative against corruption and worldliness. We must be the conscience of the fellow believers, community and nation. We must not be contaminated in the circle we move. We must fearlessly speak the truth against all evils and support all good causes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>4.     Salt makes it easier for all good things to grow. \r\n<\/b>A Christian should carry with him the quality of heaven manifesting \r\nthe characteristics of salt. &nbsp;Ultimately,  those who  know Jesus \r\nand acknowledge Him as Lord and Saviour will have eternal life. Salt \r\nis useless as long as it remains in the container. The salt must come \r\nin close contact with the food. As salt, Christians should come close \r\nto the people who are perishing and dying in sin to bring healing \r\nto them through the message of  Jesus Christ. Being salt \r\nemphasises the need for  Christians to be pure in heart and  agents that \r\npurifys the stained, troubled hearts.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>5.     Agent of Reconciliation: Salt reconciles ingredients of \r\nsoup together:<\/b> Salt brings together  ingredients of soup and make \r\nit delicious. Christians are expected to influence the world by \r\nbeing agents of reconciliation. `Since Christians in this world are \r\nthe ambassadors of Christs this means that the world is in rebellion \r\nagainst God. This world is an \"imperial province\" as far as God is \r\nconcerned. He has sent His ambassadors into the world to declare peace, \r\nnot war. \"Be ye reconciled to God!\" We represent Jesus Christ \r\n(John 20:21; 2 Corinthians 4:5).

Christians who lose their saltiness become bitter and hardened and are of little use anymore, except to be trampled under-foot. Christians, like salt, need to live as pure a life as possible so that they can maximise their ability to flavour or bless the earth through good works and make impact in their generations.

Light is often used to contrast knowledge and ignorance. Here, it stands for the world\\'s opportunity to perceive the truth about Jesus. The world is \"in the dark\" about God, but Christians \"turn on the lights.\" Light allows people to see. Christians lead the world to understand how much God loves them and what Jesus has done to restore relationship and reconcile with Him. Being the light of the world, we actually\r\ncarry out the same purpose that Jesus had in coming to earth. The Gospel of John says that when Jesus was born, \"the true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world\" (John 1:9). Also He said, \"I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life\" (John 8:12). Likewise, disciples should be like a light or lamp, which, if it is going to fulfil its function, must be on a lampstand and not hid under a bushel. The disciples were to be like a city set on a hill, and to let their light shine. The result would be that they would not attract men to themselves but would glorify the Father in heaven. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        If you have walked in the dark before, then you would know the significance of light.

God is concerned with the witness our life manifests to the world around us. Our life is constantly preaching messages to those around us and, it is not what we say that really matters often but our life's testimony; what people see us doing as Christians. The biblical word \"witness,\" does not necessarily mean \"to speak,\" but, rather, it has the meaning of our life being a reflection of God's glory to the world around us.

In the Scripture, glory means possession of the character, beauty and majesty that belong to the Lord. It means an exact representation of His being. It means reflecting His presence, His essence, His life and His name. According to the Bible, to glorify God means to bring Christ\\'s innate glory or radiance to light, to manifest it or to reflect it (John 17:1). To glorify God is to manifest all that God is. It is showing forth His Self and not our own. (John 14:13; 16:14) It\\'s His glory brought to light in us. (John 11:4; 17:1, 5). It also means to be the vehicle that conveys and reveals the true presence of God. Everything designed by God is for His glory. All creation must acknowledge and give God glory. Ultimately, when we do not acknowledge the sovereignty of God it is indeed a serious violation of God\\'s command. We are called to give God glory. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        How can Christians reflect God\\'s glory? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Our Model <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nIn the New Testament, the word glory describes the revelation of the character, nature and presence of God in the Person of Christ (John 12:28). Jesus is God\\'s glory. He is the manifestation of divine glory and He is the express image of God the Father. (Hebrews 1:3; John 17:5; John 1:i4; 2 Peter 1:17) He is the \"King of Glory.\" During Christ\\'s lifetime, He manifested the Father\\'s image perfectly; expressing the Father\\'s love to the Samaritan woman at the well and His compassion to the children He taught, His godly exhortation to His disciples and His rebuke to the Pharisees. In whatever Christ did, He glorified the Father. This, no doubt is the exact mission and purpose that Christ has for us. We are to glorify Him in all that we do (John 15:8). \"I will glorify Thy Name for evermore\" (Psalm 86:12). Jesus Christ is our role model of manifestation of God\\'s glory to this world. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        In what ways can those who have earthly hope reflect God\\'s glory? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Our Responsibility <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe Bible tells us that our creativity as human beings comes from being made in the image of the Master Creator (Genesis 1:27). We were created to manifest His glory (Isaiah 43:7). Glorifying God does \r\nnot come automatically except we walk in the Spirit. Therefore, our primary purpose as Christians is to reflect God\\'s glory rather than self. We must learn to obey and follow Him, be cleansed by His blood, filled with His Spirit and then walk by His Spirit, so that we can show forth His likeness to the world. To do otherwise is to be carnal, and carnal Christians primarily focus only on worldly things and do not do the will of God. They do not reflect the glory of God and are not transformed into Christ\\'s glowing image and character. Our life's goal is to reflect God's glory through Christ to our world. Reflecting God's glory involves allowing God to take charge of our lives, and being the Chief Commander from whom we take instructions. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are Satan's strategies to silent God's people so as not to manifest the glory of God in their lives? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Our lives should reflect the nature, attributes and character of the life of Jesus Christ.

We are God\\'s agents specifically called and designed to make His glory known everywhere we go. Each of us is wired to be \"transformed into His likeness with ever-increasing glory.\" Day after day as we fellowship with one another, and focus on the things of God, we will shine brighter and brighter, and there will indeed be \"ever-increasing glory.\" At the end of each day every one of us can think back over the day and see whether we have really fellowship with Christ and give ourselves to Him or not. If we do, we will have peace of mind. The world is a dark place and people need the light of Christ that we can shine into their lives.

The strong can influence the weak for good or the weak can influence the strong for evil. Also, the fruit we bear affects our influence and vice versa. Our lifestyle should lend credence to what we profess and respectability to the truths we believe. Disciple\\'s lifestyle should never become a list of rules but imitating the Master must be our focus and priority.

This message transforms individuals and enables them to lead godly lives. Mandated by the Scripture (Matthew 28:19-20), Christians are charged to share the goodnews and disciple others in the faith. The Gospel is a holistic message with implications for all areas of life, including how Christians can engage in the political process.

Christ' disciples' worldview speaks to all areas of \r\nlife:<\/b> It speaks to all areas of life, including political engagement. In fact, the Bible \r\nspeaks about civil government and provides examples of faithful \r\nengagement. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.      Politics is \r\ninescapable:<\/b> Augustine's <em>City of God<\/em> offers \r\nguidance on this point. Believers are citizens of the \"City of God\", but on \r\nthis side of eternity, we also belong to the \"City of Man\" and \r\ntherefore must be good citizens of both cities. This reality makes politics\r\ninescapable for Christ\\'s disciples as it concerns who control \r\ntheir political future. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.      Christ\\'s disciples need to love their \r\nneighbour:<\/b> In a very real sense of neighbourliness, politics is one of the most important \r\nareas in which Christians demonstrate love to neighbours. Loving \r\na neighbour includes volunteering at a homeless shelter, as well \r\nas influencing laws that encourage human flourishing.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.      Government war against evil and promotes \r\ngood:<\/b> Government derives its authority from God to promote good and restrain evil. \r\nThis mandate is expressly stated in Romans 13:1-7. Christian witness in \r\nthe public square contributes transcendent values about moral and \r\nethical issues. Politics affects government, shapes society and influences \r\nculture. Because of what the Bible teaches and the inevitability of its effect \r\non our culture, Christians must care about politics. \r\n<\/p>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are the things Christians in politics should do away with? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> What Christ's Disciples Should Remember about Politics <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are four things to remember about politics which serve as guide for Christ's disciples. \r\n<\/p><p><b>1.      Remember the Bible enjoins us to obey the laws of the \r\nland.<\/b> There is no doubt that our responsibility to government is to obey \r\nthe laws and be good citizens (Romans 13:1-2). God has established \r\nall authority, and He does so for our benefit, \"to commend those who \r\ndo right\" (1Peter 2:13-15). Paul tells us in Romans 13:1-8 that it is \r\nthe government's responsibility to rule in authority over us  hopefully \r\nfor our good  to collect taxes, and to keep the peace. Where we have \r\na voice and can elect our leaders, we should exercise that right by \r\nvoting for those who best demonstrate Christian principles.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.      Remember the Bible tells us to pray for our governing \r\nauthorities (1Timothy 2:1-4) and to respect those in authority (Romans \r\n13:1-7).<\/b> God commands us to pray for our leaders to rule well as such \r\nprayer is good and welcomed before God our Saviour.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.      Remember Christ must be Lord of our political \r\nviews.<\/b> That may sound obvious, but it is anything but obvious in practice. \r\nPeople whose lives are otherwise in submission to Christ have a \r\ntendency to forget about His lordship when the subject turns to politics. \r\nThey have not thought through what the Bible says about politics and \r\nour involvement in that area. But if Christ is Lord of all of life and if \r\nthe Bible speaks about political matters, then we must allow Him to \r\nbe Lord of our political views.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.      Christian politicians must remember that their duty to the \r\nLord must take precedence over the duties of their \r\noffice.<\/b> Paul tells us that whatever we do, we are to do it for the glory of the Lord, \r\nnot our own (1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17). If a Christian \r\ndoes seek office, it should only be if he can faithfully execute the duties \r\nof that office to the glory of God and without compromising \r\nChristian principles.\r\n<\/p>         \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are other things Christians in politics should remember? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Christian witness in the public contributes transcendent values about moral and ethical issues.

Galatians 6:10 says, \"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially those who belong to the family of believers.\" The Church is made up of academics, the technocrats, the singles, the unemployed, the traders and professionals, etc. who are thirsty for messages from all available channels of the Church to give them direction and transform their lives. If our mandate is to support Christian political leaders, we should not be in the dark or be ignorant but consciously use the following channels.\r\n\r\n<\/p><p><b>1.     Pulpit Channel:<\/b> A number of our ministers are afraid to use \r\nthe pulpit to discuss politics except during national day \r\ncelebrations. Their fear could be understood. They think the only \r\nassignment they have is to direct the congregation to heaven without \r\nearthly relevance in socio-economic and political realms. This \r\nshould not be so. The mere fact that politics is preached as a \r\nmessage does not translate that the whole Church is being sold to a \r\nsingle party in a nation that runs a multi-party system. Pastors \r\nshould therefore preach it on the pulpit for members of \r\ntheir congregations to know that it is their responsibility to \r\nsupport Christians in political positions. The congregations should \r\nbe made to know that such Christian political leaders have \r\ngone there to represent the entire body of Christ. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.     Use of Various Groups in the \r\nChurch:<\/b> A number of denominations have different groups through which \r\neducation and enlightenment could be given on why Christian \r\npolitical leaders should be supported. In the Baptist denomination \r\nin Nigeria, such groups include the <em>MMU, WMU, Youths, \r\nStudent Fellowship, Lydia, Royal Ambassadors <\/em>and so on. \r\nThese groups can disseminate information on  current political affairs.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.     Denominational \r\nLiterature:<\/b> The various denominational literatures could be used to promote political participation \r\nat least once in a year. Learning is a continuous process \r\nand knowledge has no limit.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>4.     Church Library:<\/b> Essential documents that are absent in \r\nmost libraries are the <em>Constitution of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria <\/em>and<em> Electoral Act.<\/em> The church library should not \r\nbe filled up with biblical literature only but also with \r\nnewspapers, magazines and cuttings from topical political issues and editorials.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>5.     Debate:<\/b> Debates are necessary to propel cross-fertilisation \r\nof ideas. Such issues are \\'Should women participate in \r\npolitics? Who is a good manager of resourcesmen or women? Which \r\nis better  two party system or multi-party system?\\' This kind \r\nof forum will further stimulate the consciousness of the \r\ncongregation on politics. \r\n<\/p>\r\n         \r\n        \r\n              \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Christians view politics from different perspectives because of perceived dangers in it but can we stand aloof?

But before that, God, in Genesis 1:26 said, `\\'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness to rule over other creatures.\" Genesis 1:28 highlights the assignments given to Man.

He gave us good and perfect life. He is the ultimate giver of life (James 1:17). When we openly thank God as the giver of life, we begin to gain true perspective on both the gift and the giver. We gain a reputation for being happy in the joy of the Lord and naturally want to draw other people in to share what we have. Paul\\'s message in Acts 17:24-25 presents it this way: \"The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.\" Jesus in John 11 wants us to recognise God as the giver of life through the miracle of raising Lazarus. Jesus gave thanks to God from an essential understanding of who He is, and because He wants others to know Him too. In turn, we can give thanks to God because we know who He is and who we are in relationship with Him. He is the Giver and Sustainer of Life.\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        What are reasons why some recognise creatures than the Creator? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Reasons for Thanking God for the Gift of Life  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n<p>Life is a pilgrimage: The concept of pilgrimage is \r\ntremendously important to the Christian, giving guidance on the believer\\'s stance in \r\nall circumstances of life. Without this concept, we become ingrates, \r\nunable to give thanks to God and unnecessarily sensitive to all the problems \r\nand trials of life. Jacob spoke of `the days of my pilgrimage in Genesis \r\n47:7-10; the heroes of faith in Hebrews 11 declared by their lifestyle that \r\nthey were strangers and pilgrims on earth. This concept should ignite in \r\nevery believer a response of thanksgiving to God  the giver of life.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Life is ephemeral: <\/b>The time of life is short. In fact, life is a tenure \r\nand temporary. The lamentation of Moses on brevity of human life \r\nbecomes intelligible and appropriate for thanksgiving. The truth according to \r\nPsalm 90 is that times flies and life is short! Each of us needs to give thanks \r\nto God and evaluate how we use the precious gift of life. Regarding each \r\nday as a valuable gift of God should spur us to give thanks to Him. \r\nJacob alluded to the time of life in Genesis 47:9, `\\'\u2026My year has been few\u2026\\'\\'\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Life is preserved by \r\nGod:<\/b> Believers in Christ Jesus should not only remain grateful to God for the assurance that He is going to preserve us,but for the preservation we had enjoyed from Him. By preserving \r\nus, God maintained in safety from injury, peril, or harm. The preservation \r\nof God in our lives is like an insurance policy God has taken out on \r\nour behalf. God is the ultimate insurance policy for believers! He does \r\nnot only preserve but elongates our lives, (Deuteronomy 30:20). This \r\ncalls for thanksgiving (Psalm 121:7-8). That the Lord is always actively \r\nworking to preserve us in the face of challenges of life and from all evil is a \r\ngood reason to thank Him.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Life is valuable to God: \r\n<\/b>Our response of thanksgiving to Him should recognise that life is valuable to God.

The longer a person has known Christ the greater the temptation to take salvation for granted and to forget the tragedy of what it is like to be lost. Salvation is a free gift of God. As we consider how to give thanks to God for His salvation, let us rejoice in the Lord and delight in His salvation (Psalm 35:9).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Thanking God for the Gift of Salvation  <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        \r\n<p>Salvation is achieved by God \r\nalone: Our entire salvation, from first to last, is due to God alone, \"the author and finisher of our faith\\'\\' \r\n(Hebrews 12:2), for from Him and to Him and through Him are all \r\nthings\u2026and, therefore, all the praise, glory, thanks and honour for our new life is to be given to God alone. We must conclude that it is not scriptural \r\nto thank and praise God for 95 per cent of salvation, and then give man \r\nthe credit for the remaining 5 per cent. If God is thanked for man\\'s new \r\nlife in Christ, it must be because He alone is perceived as responsible for \r\nit (Ephesians 2:8-9).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Salvation is grounded entirely on what Christ has done for \r\nus: <\/b>Our salvation is grounded entirely on what Christ has done for us. \r\nWhat we could not produce or provide (faith and obedience), Jesus \r\nproduced and provided for us. It is based solely on Jesus\\' saving work that \r\nwe should thank God, a work done entirely outside and external to us. \r\nFirst, salvation is grounded on Christ\\'s work of atonement. We are \r\n\"being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in \r\nChrist Jesus\" (Romans 3:24 NASB). The design of the gospel is to \r\nmagnify God\\'s glory and this is done to the greatest degree by a free, \r\njustifying grace. This work of salvation in Christ Jesus calls for thanksgiving \r\nto God. This is because, it is done when man\\'s involvement is \r\nentirely excluded, when man is entirely debased (Romans 5:8).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Our living hope in our great salvation: \r\n<\/b>Another reason the believer should thank God for salvation is because God has brought us into a \r\nliving hope. If your hope is built on the economy of a nation, your career, \r\nyour family, or your investments, it will come to nothing. The economy is \r\nshaky at best; one could lose his career or retirement comes. Life as we know \r\nit will eventually come to an end. These are dead hopes because one \r\nday they will come to nothing. Yet these are the only hopes that the world \r\ncan really have. But he who have been saved through faith in Christ have \r\na hope that will last forever (I John 2:17).

However, the inheritance of the believer in the New Covenant is much greater than that of the Old Covenant. It is imperishable, undefiled, unfading and it is being reserved in heaven by God. This is something to thank God for because in this life our inheritance is temporal at best. The money we save fluctuates in value with the economy; it is prone to be lost, but not our inheritance in heaven (Matthew 6:19-20). Christians are co-heirs with Christ. Everything that is Christ\\'s is ours (Romans 8:17). However, the greatest part of our inheritance is God. He is our portion, He is our joy, and in heaven we will have unhindered fellowship with Him (Psalms 73:26; 16:5).

This is something we should get excited about and thank God for. There is a day coming when we will no longer wrestle with pride, fight against lust or temptation. One day, we will be completely like Christ and until that time, we fight and \"work out our salvation\" so we can look more and more like our Lord.

You can have ultimate confidence that Christ will lose none (John 18:7-9). Our God guards the faith of the saints. Our thanksgiving to God should recognise the fact that each believer is called to make their election sure by growing in their faith so that they no longer will be tossed to and fro at every temptation or failure (2 Peter 1:10; Ephesians 4:14).\r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 4 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Why do some believers still offer animal sacrifice for their salvation apart from what God has done for mankind in Jesus Christ? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 4 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        If you have experienced God\\'s salvation through Jesus Christ, then you should be filled with joy and thanksgiving.

This is because He knows and abundantly provides for all our needs. These needs may include:\r\n\r\n<\/p><p><b>1.     Material needs.<\/b> We do not have a `divine right\\' to prosperity, \r\nas some have falsely taught. But neither do we need to feel guilty \r\nabout the material things God provides for us. We should hold these \r\nthings lightly, giving thanks, and remembering that they belong to God, \r\nnot to us (Exodus 8:10). We are just manager for Him, not owners. \r\nTo whom much is given, much is required (Luke 12:48). We need not\r\nto be ungrateful for His provision. When God blesses us materially \r\nwe can thankfully enjoy the things He has richly supplied (Philippians 4:19).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.     Emotional needs<\/b>. God is good and we owe Him gratitude \r\nfor providing for our emotional needs. God wants us to be \r\nemotionally whole. He does not always do it instantly or when we think \r\nHe should. He often does it by bringing healing to relationships \r\nwith family members and others who have hurt us. But even if they \r\nnever respond, the Lord teaches us how to forgive and to have \r\nour emotional needs met in Him. We must thank Him for this \r\nprovision. The fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) describes an \r\nemotionally whole person. Fruit takes time to grow, but every believer who \r\nwalks in the Spirit is promised that fruit of emotional wholeness (3 John 2).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>3.     Spiritual needs<\/b>. God\\'s ultimate goal is always spiritual. We \r\nmust thank Him because He always has a spiritual reason behind \r\nany material blessings He supplied or withholds. God is shaping us to \r\nbe channels to convey His blessings to lost people. To do that, He \r\nhas provided abundantly in Christ for all of our spiritual needs, \r\neven when we are not aware of them. We must thank Him for \r\nmaking provision for our spiritual needs (Ephesians 1:3; 2 Peter 1:3).\r\n<\/p>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Why are some stingy in giving generously to others as God meets their needs abundantly on daily basis? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>  God Provides for Our Needs in His Timing, Not Ours <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nAnother lesson about God\\'s provision that provides another reason to give thanks to God is the provision of God for our needs in His timing (Ecclesiastes 3:11). God provides for our needs in His timing, not ours. Let us appreciate Him and give Him thanks because His time is always perfect and beautiful. God abundantly provides for our every need, but He doesn\\'t necessarily do it just when we think He should. He does it in His time, often letting us come to the very edge, so that we will learn to trust in Him (2 Corinthians1:8-9).

He blesses us because of His Son, Jesus. If we are in Him, then we have got connections in high places! He provides blessings for us often when we have not trusted Him as we should. Why? Because of our relationship with Jesus. God even took our sin, which sent Jesus to the cross, and used the cross as the means of our salvation. Where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more (Romans 5:20). Why did Pharaoh provide so abundantly for Jacob and his eleven sons? It certainly was not because they were wonderful people .Jacob\\'s sons should not have been blessed because of the way they had treated their brother and father. But they were blessed anyway, apart from any merit on their part, because of their relationship with Joseph. God took their act of sin, selling their own brother into slavery, and made it the means of their deliverance from famine. God doesn't bless us because we are such deserving people. For this reason, we should respond to His provision through thanksgiving. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Why do we need to \"give thanks in all circumstances? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        As Christ's disciples, we must always reflect on the Lord\\'s provision in meeting all our needs, we will see that God is worthy to receive our thanks and praises.

God\\'s providence is His Almighty and ever present power, whereby as with His hand, He still upholds heaven and earth and all creatures and governs them. The main thing you need to know about this is that God is not disconnected from what is happening in the world today. There is no such thing as chance or luck or fate or karma. Rather, God is upholding, governing and ordering all things. \"Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps\" (Psalm 135:6).

The word `protection' may bring up images of law enforcement agents, safety appliances, or office security systems. You may likely remember someone or something that has been put in place to keep you out of harm's way. However, these protective measures do not always work. Despite having burglar alarms in place, homes and businesses are still broken into almost daily. Vehicle thefts continue to rise and hackers still invade our privacy by spying on us through the internet. But the true source of protection is God Almighty. God our refuge must be thanked for His protection over our lives. \"For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe\" (Psalms 61:3). He alone must receive credit and thanksgiving for the protection we are enjoying every day. We can give thanks to Him by praising His holy name. He is our Shield, Fortress, Hiding Place, Keeper, Refuge, Rock, Shade, Shelter, and Stronghold (Psalms 46:1, 91). \"The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou saved me from violence.

We need His protection because we are so weak and so vulnerable, but He is powerful. There are so many things that can hurt us, that without Him we could not survive. But His power is keeping us. He did not withdraw His presence. He remains our refuge till today (Psalms 23:4). This God deserves to receive our thanksgiving. In fact, without the Lord protecting us from those things which threaten our spirits, we would not survive for a single moment. Believers should always appreciate the Lord\\'s protection. Our God deserves to receive our thanksgiving, He is a Mighty Fortress.

Yes, God can stop any evil or destruction but we must remember that we live in a fallen world where we have freewill and sometimes God works in ways that we do not understand. Sometimes God's protection comes in the form of peace and strength in the middle of despair; at other times it comes as an ending because He sees something more on the horizon that we cannot see. As a believer in Jesus, we are promised a new life covered under the protection of God in which nothing can separate us.

Though God is our protector, but we must do our part by not tempting Him. God does protect us according to His will (Psalms 91:1-16), this means \"in our best interest\" (even though we may not be able to see it at the time).

But should be noted that, God\\'s choice and favour over a person can qualify him\/her for His assignment. Mary was qualified to conceive the Messiah because she was a highly favoured virgin. There had been a prophecy in the Old Testament that the Saviour would come through a virgin. So, she fits into that prophecy. Nevertheless, Mary was not the only virgin in Israel, but God favoured and chose her. Since God is omniscient, probably He must have seen in Mary certain virtues which made Him favour her. Therefore, we must establish that beyond being a virgin and being engaged to a man from the linage of David, Mary was highly favoured by God. As a disciple, you must exhibit godly virtues that can attract God\\'s favour. One of such characters is holiness. Let holiness be your hallmark and do not compromise your faith in Christ. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Mention and discuss some godly virtues that can attract God\\'s favour to you. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>Mary's Submission to God's will  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe word \"Submission\" according to the Encarta dictionary is \"the act of yielding or surrendering to somebody\" especially to a higher authority. Submission, as a virtue, may be difficult to exhibit especially when one is full of ego. But for Mary, she did not allow ego, fear, people's speculations and the consequences of being pregnant outside wedlock to deter her from submitting to God. The fact is, as a human, she was surprised at the angel\\'s message, and that necessitated her question: \"How will this be, since I am a virgin?\" Nevertheless, after the angel answered her question. Her response:she received the message and responded thus: I am the Lord\\'s servant. May it be to me as you have said (Luke 1:38, NIV). This shows that she agreed wholeheartedly with God. What could have helped Mary to submit promptly to God? Faith! She believed in God that He could use her. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        <p> As Christ\\'s disciples, we must know and accept that Christ saved us for His good purposes.

One day, he travelled to Lagos for an important business with the mind to quickly return to Abeokuta for a naming ceremony. He boarded a taxi at Ojuelegba which was going his direction. The taxi picked another lady to make the passenger complete. Suddenly, two men who were seated with them at the back, just covered their faces with handkerchiefs and that was all they remembered, only to wake up and found themselves naked in a very big compound with a huge fence. They were in front of an herbalist who asked for their names. The lady\\'s name was Grace, but bearing Grace could not save anyone who is not under grace. The herbalist said she would be useful for money ritual, while Segun was not. But the evil men were angry that Segun was not useful for ritual. So they gave him pap to eat and asked him to be cutting grass at the back of the house while preparing to use Grace. As he was cutting grass, God showed His ultimate power by filling Segun with the Holy Spirit and asked him to go and face the ritualists. He obeyed the Holy Spirit and confronted them by speaking in tongues. When they saw him and heard him saying some things, they were all confused and ran away. Segun then loosed Grace, they and picked their both clothes and ran away. After running in the bush for some days, they found themselves at the Nigeria\/Benin Republic boundary.

God initiated the whole process of the birth of Jesus. The power of the almighty God miraculously brought about the virginal conception by the direct action of the Holy Spirit. The virgin birth of Christ established two basic facts. Firstly, it asserted a real human nature in Christ taken from His mother. Secondly, it asserted a real divine nature because of His supernatural birth which was unique in the history of humankind, setting Jesus apart as one Who has both true and genuine humanity and undiminished deity united in one Person forever. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5>  God's Ultimate Power in Christmas Story  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nGod's ultimate power has to do with His supremacy, sovereignty and authority in control of the affairs of humankind. There is nothing our God cannot do and no one can question Him for what He does or does not do. From the story of the birth of Jesus Christ in Matthew 1:18-23, God displayed His power by making a virgin to be pregnant. He also communicated His intention to Joseph, her betrothed husband. God\\'s power over nature is revealed in using a star to announce the birth to the Magi and using the star to guide them to the baby to worship Him and offer Him gifts. This shows that God can use anything, animate or inanimate, to bring about His purpose for humanity. The gifts that the Magi offered to Jesus were symbolic of His redemptive mission on earth. Furthermore, God\\'s power was revealed in the fact that He was in control of every event which surrounded the birth of Jesus Christ. The decree that everyone should go for census in their home town, God\\'s instructions to the Magi not to return to King Herod and to Joseph to take the baby and His mother to Egypt for asylum, were proofs of God\\'s power in action. God\\'s power is still available today. We can experience it if we walk closely with Him daily and genuinely trust Him. Whatever may be your life\\'s challenge marital, academic, economic\/financial, health, social, child bearing trust God absolutely. Our God does great things and He will show His power in your situation. God\\'s power is still available today to deliver and to save. You too will experience this power in your life and family in Jesus\\' name. \r\n        <\/p> \r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Describe the power of God in the incarnation of Jesus.

He says, <em>\"She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins\" <\/em>(Matthew 1:21).\r\nGod does not want us to perish, hence the reason for allowing Jesus Christ to come into the world (John 3:16). God's generosity is evidenced in this sacrificial giving of His Son to come and save humanity from sin. If God could be so generous not to spare His only Son, will He not be ready to give us all other good things our hearts desire according to His will? Or will He not expect us to emulate His character by extending helping hands to the needy around us? As Christ's disciples today, we must trust God and depend solely on Him to supply our needs at this Christmas season. We should refrain from seeking for help where there is no help and avoid going into debt because of cloth. We must also emulate God's generous attitude by being ready to give to those who need our help. Our lives should be channels of blessings to others around us. Christmas season is a time to reflect on God\\'s generosity to us and to let the act of generosity spread to others through us, to fellow believers and unbelievers alike. We should give our love, our substance, our time, our kind words of advice etc to others. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        These days, can God still display His power in unusual ways in our midst? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 3 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n       \r\n        \r\n    <\/ol> <!-- END OF THE INTERACTION PERIOD -->\r\n\r\n        <h4> Facilitator's Closing Remarks <\/h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Do you doubt God because of what you are passing through?

It is an act of submission to authority. It is also the quality of being obedient. It is a behaviour that is respectful of rules and laws. Obedience to God is a \r\n        sign that you love Him. It is important to God and He expects all His children to obey Him. After discovering Mary was pregnant, it was difficult for Joseph to take her as a wife and went on with the marriage plans; but when he knew it was God\\'s will, he obeyed. Likewise the Magi, though they lived thousands of miles away from where Jesus was born, yet they took it upon themselves to visit the newborn king. Their obedience to God\\'s instruction not to go back to Herod was a loyalty to God that all of us should emulate. We have invited two pastors to help us in this discussion. Our first guest is Pastor Olaide Alao, who just graduated from the Baptist College of Theology, Benin city, and Pastor Mrs Oluwakemi Odediran, who graduated from the Nigerian Baptist Theological Seminary, Ogbomoso. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p><b>Facilitator<\/b>: You are welcome to this programme sir and ma.    <\/p>\r\n<p>We will start with Pastor Olaide Alao: Sir, why is it difficult for \r\nsome Christians to obey God\\'s Word today?\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Pastor Olaide Alao:<\/b> Human beings are increasingly becoming \r\nself-centred. They want others to obey and serve them but they are \r\nnot ready to obey someone in authority over them. People find it difficult \r\nto obey God because of the sinful nature which is still active. \r\nSubmission comes before obedience, and not many are willing to submit to \r\nGod, hence  obedience is difficult.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Sharing Time:<\/b> In your own opinion, why is it not easy for Christians \r\nto obey God?\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Facilitator:<\/b> Thank you sir. Can you also shed light on the evidence \r\nof obedience in Joseph\\'s life?\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Pastor Olaide Alao: \r\n<\/b>The<b> <\/b>obedience of Joseph can be seen in \r\nthe following instances:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>1.     He followed God\\'s instruction through Angel Gabriel to take \r\nMary as his wife because her pregnancy was of the Holy Spirit and that she would give birth to the Saviour of the world.  He also named \r\nthe baby \"Jesus\" as the angel told him. He believed and trusted \r\nthe angel\\'s message and accepted Mary (Matthew 1:20-25).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>2.     He and his wife obeyed Caesar Augustus decree that everyone \r\nshould travel to his home of origin for census, despite Mary\\'s \r\nadvanced state of pregnancy. His obedience made the prophecy that \r\nJesus will be born at Bethlehem to be fulfilled (Luke 2:1-7).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>3.      He followed God's instruction to move Mary and Baby Jesus \r\nto Egypt for protection against King Herod\\'s evil plan to kill \r\n\"Jesus\". He did not leave Egypt until when God told him to return \r\nwhen Herod died (Matthew 2:13-15, 19-21).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Facilitator:<\/b> Thank you sir for that beautiful exposition. We now \r\nlisten to our mummy. Ma, what are those things that helped Joseph to \r\nobey God's Word?\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Pastor Mrs Oluwakemi \r\nOdediran:<\/b> Thank you our facilitator. Looking into the passage read, we would observe some qualities in Joseph\\'s \r\nlife. These include:\r\n<\/p><p><b>1.     Just and tender \r\nheart:<\/b> the Bible says, \"then Joseph her \r\nhusband, being a just man\" (Matthew 1:19). In the Jewish beliefs and \r\npractices, if a betrothed lady becomes pregnant for another man, she \r\nshould be stoned to death. Joseph was faced with only two options; \r\neither to divorce Mary quietly or to expose her and have her stoned \r\nto death. He eventually chose to divorce her secretly. At the \r\nangel\\'s intervention and explanation, his just and tender heart towards \r\nMary helped him to obey. It simply means Joseph was a clean, pure \r\nand holy man before God. If a man is just before God, obedience \r\nwill not be difficult. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.<\/b>     <b>Spiritual sensitivity: \r\n<\/b>Joseph was a descendant of King David and was sensitive to God\\'s guidance. There were prophesies that \r\nthe Messiah will come from the lineage of David and it appears \r\nthat Joseph may not be able to stop God\\'s plan even if he would \r\nnot obey the commandment. What should also be noticed about Joseph was his sensitivity to God\\'s guidance. He knew the way God \r\nspoke to him and he was ready to obey. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>3.      <b>Fear of God and desire to please Him: \r\n<\/b>Joseph, being a righteous man, according to the Scriptures, is a clear evidence of the fear \r\nof God in him and this automatically stirred up his desire to \r\nplease God. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>4.     <b>Genuine love for God and Mary: \r\n<\/b>In<b> <\/b>the first instance, Joseph's decision not to subject Mary to public ridicule shows that he \r\nloved her genuinely. This also helped him to obey the Word of God \r\nthrough the angel. Jesus tells His disciples, \"If you love me, you will \r\nobey what I command\" (John 14:15, NIV).\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>5.           Absolute faith and trust in God's Word: \r\n<\/b>Joseph's absolute faith and trust in God helped him to obey the angel's messages to \r\nhim. According to Rick Warren \"... we must show our faith by \r\ndoing what God tells us to do\". Therefore, Joseph's obedience \r\nrevealed his faith in God. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sharing Time:<\/b> Mention those qualities that helped Joseph to obey \r\nGod's will? \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Facilitator:<\/b> Thank you ma. Sir, what are those things that helped \r\nthe Magi (wise men) to obey God\\'s Word?\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Pastor Olaide Alao: \r\n<\/b><\/p><p><b>1.     They were truth \r\nseekers:<\/b> The Magi were truth seekers. To obey God's instructions may be difficult but when you are actually \r\nseeking the truth, you will be ready to do anything. Unfortunately today, \r\nnot many people come to church to seek the truth about Jesus. \r\nSome come to church to fulfil all righteousness or to follow traditions. \r\nYou cannot obey God when you are not a truth seeker.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>2.     The wise men have the right motive for seeking \r\nJesus:<\/b> They said in Matthew 2:2, \"Where is He, who has been born king of \r\nthe Jews? For we have seen His star in the east and have come \r\nto worship Him.'' The main reason why they were seeking Jesus was to worship Him. Since they have accepted Him as King, it was \r\nthen easy for them to obey the instruction given to them by God: \r\n\"being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to \r\nHerod, they departed for their own country another way\" Matthew 2:12. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sharing Time:<\/b> Mention those qualities that helped the Magi to \r\nobey God's Word?\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Facilitator:<\/b> Thank you sir. You have to understand that God \r\ndeserves our worship and submission. These can be actualised when we learn \r\nto obey Him in all things. Though others may have disapproved of \r\nJoseph's decision to continue with Mary,  he chose to obey God. Like \r\nJoseph, we must choose to obey God rather than seek the approval of man. \r\n  <\/p>      \r\n        <h4>Activity Period <\/h4>\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> How have you been handling God's instructions to you?  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  1 -->\r\n        <li> Tell someone this week about the importance of obedience to God's Word and qualities that can help him or her to obey.  <\/li> <!-- Activity PERIOD  2 -->\r\n        <\/ol><\/p>"},{"id":51,"title":"god's protection and intervention (herod's evil plan) ","message":"<p><center>\r\n\r\n            <h4> DECEMBER WEEK 4 <\/h4> <!--JANUARY: WEEK 1-->\r\n            <h3> GOD'S PROTECTION AND INTERVENTION (HEROD'S EVIL PLAN)  <\/h3>  <!--TITLE-->\r\n\r\n<\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <p> <b> HYMN: BH 40 <\/b>  A Mighty Fortress Is Our God  <\/p> <!--HYMN TITLE, LET THE BH Number be in the bold tag and the others in the p tag-->\r\n        <p> <b> SCRIPTURE: <\/b> Matthew 2:13-20    <\/p> <!--SCRIPTURE here -->\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4>Objectives :<\/h4>\r\n        <p>By the end of the lesson, members  should be able to:<\/p>\r\n\r\n        <ol>\r\n        <li> Express their faith in the saving power of God;  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 1 -->\r\n        <li>  Explain the different ways by which God demonstrate's and reveals His power of protection over Jesus; and  <\/li> <!-- OBJECTIVE 2 -->\r\n        <li> Pray for grace to trust God for His intervention in all their challenges. <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n        <!-- ICE BREAKING PERIOD TYPE HERE -->\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b> ICE BREAKING PERIOD:  <\/b>\r\n            Sharing \r\n        <\/p> \r\n\r\n         <p>\r\n            Two to three members should share their personal experiences of God's protection and intervention from\/in dangerous situations and their convictions about God's saving power.\r\n         <\/p> <!-- MESSAGE  1 -->\r\n                    \r\n        <h4>Facilitator's Opening Remarks<\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        Many times, we face situations and circumstances that are too difficult for us.

He saw Jesus as the one who had come to take up his position and so he was envious of Him. He told the Magi to go and search for Jesus so that he too could come and worship Him, though he had the intention to kill Jesus. This confirms is the Word of God that says \"the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure, who can understand it? (Jeremiah 17:9). These are two opposite responses to Jesus' birth. The Magi saw the star and they traced it to go and worship the new born king; Herod heard the news and became angry and a murderer. How do you normally respond to another person's success? Do you feel happy and then rejoice with them or you despise the person's success because of your pride or ego? As Christ's disciples, God expects us to be happy with other people's success and then rejoice with them. We must avoid envying and despising others for their success. Envy can lead to hatred and subsequently lead to murder. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Can you explain why Herod was troubled when he heard the news of the new king? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> God's Protection and Intervention: Matthew 2:12-21 <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        <p>\r\nTo every evil plan concerning God's children, there is always God's intervention.

God can equally use any other spiritual gifts to expose the evil plans of the enemy. All you need do is to be attentive and identify the way God communicates to you. Also, God can protect His people and intervene in their situations by sending His angels.

Even some so-called \"prophets\" brag on the media that they can give life. Today, we shall be examining how Jesus is the only source of life. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- Facilitator\\'s Opening Remarks MESSAGE -->\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <h4>EDUCATION\/INTERACTION PERIOD <\/h4>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <ol type=\"I\">\r\n\r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Life in its Broad Sense <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThere are three forms of life; the physical, the spiritual and the eternal life. Life has no limitation, and it is to be understood in its widest sense. Quoting Webster, Cheryl Anderson defines life as \"the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual\". He further adds that life is a continuum of accomplishment, failure, discovery, dilemma, challenge, boredom, sadness, disappointments, appreciation, the giving and receipt of grace, empathy, peace, and our reactions to all sorts of stimuli touch, love, friendship, loss... Life is the ability to grow, change or exist physically, spiritually or eternally. \r\n<\/p><p> <b>1. Physical life: <\/b> Life begins at conception. Scientists say human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization and conception takes place when the fertilized egg (zygote) implanted itself in the uterus. The zygote then develops into foetus and continues to develop until the delivery period. After the delivery, the growth even becomes faster and life continues. The ability to move, act, live, work, think, play and labour is called life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>2. Spiritual life: <\/b>This is a state of life that begins with an encounter with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is when one is convicted of his\/her sinful nature by the Holy Spirit, confessed those sins, asked God for forgiveness and cleansing of his\/her sins and surrender his\/her life to Jesus Christ as his\/her personal Saviour and Lord. At this point, there is spiritual conversion from the kingdom of Satan to that of God through salvation, and so a new life (spiritual life) begins in the person; which is basically brought about by an inner transformation. When this happens, the spiritual life develops through prayer, Bible study, fasting, fellowship with other Christians and witnessing to non-Christians.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>3. Eternal life:<\/b> This is a spiritual existence after the death of the body; though, eternal life is not something that begins when we get to heaven but something we possess in this life by knowing God. John 17 verse 3 says. \"Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\" This suggests that eternal life is the ultimate goal of salvation in Christ here on earth and a successful journey of that salvation guarantees a life after here with Christ. <\/p>\r\n         <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 1 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Explain the emergence of life and the activity of God in making life meaningful. \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 1 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 TITLE -->\r\n        <h5> Jesus Christ, the Source of Life  <\/h5> \r\n        \r\n        <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 2 BODY -->\r\n        \r\n        <ol>\r\n\r\n        <li><b>Biblical basis: <\/b> The Bible says in John 1:4, \"In Him was life\". This suggests that quality and truthful life is found in Jesus Christ. Only in Him we can find meaning for our existence. An author said that Jesus Christ is the Creator of life and His life brings light to human aid. Before the world was created Jesus Christ had life and this life is what enlightens the physical and spiritual lives. The same life will see us through the world to the life eternal. It is written in the book of Acts that, \"In Him we live and move and have our being\u2026\" (Acts 17:28). Everything we are and will be finds its source in Christ.<\/li>\r\n        <li> <b>He came that we might have life: John 10:10 <\/b> When Jesus was born, the Bible says.\" \u2026And you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins\" (Matthew 1:21). He actually came to the world at Christmas to give life to the world by giving us free salvation. No one would have been able to do this for us except Jesus, who came purposely that we might have life. He is the Bread of life (John 6:41); He is the water of life (John 4:13-14); He is life Himself (John 11:25; 14:6). <\/li>\r\n        <\/ol>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Sharing Time:<\/b>\r\n        Can you give reasons and evidence of Jesus being the source of life? \r\n        <\/p> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD SHARING TIME 2 -->\r\n      \r\n        <\/li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n        <h5> Jesus is the life-giving Spirit: I Corinthians 15:45 <\/h5> <!-- INTERACTION PERIOD 3 TITLE -->\r\n        <p>\r\nThe first Adam was made man, lived as man and died as man.

As we move to another year, the question to ask is; have you found this new life? If yes, congratulations. I encourage you to continue to live that new life for Jesus Christ the giver of life.

Jesus Christ though God Himself did not consider it robbery to be equal with God (Philippians 2:6). There is no life elsewhere but in Christ Jesus alone.

How do we celebrate Christmas? Do we give foods and gifts to only those in church or we extend it to the lost ones? Do you obey God and His instructions for you? Do you rely solely on His power to save and deliver? Ponder on it whether you are an exemplary Christian, a true disciple. Jesus Christ came into the world that the world through Him might be saved. The story of Christmas is known by all men and we are being reminded again that a disciple of Christ will go back to the Bible and appropriate its message to day to day life. The focus of Jesus' birth is love for the world (John 3:16). Thus, the lifestyle of a disciple should be one that manifests the love of God in Christ to the world through giving and sharing. Be like Christ by showing love to all men Christians and non-Christians. Have you received the challenge to tell the stories of Christmas to the world, emphasising the messages of love, salvation, freedom and sharing? As Christ's disciple, are you committed to living your life now and in eternity for Jesus Who is the only source of life? <\/p><\/p>"}]
